Therefore, species that are closely related have fewer accumulated mutations and more similar base sequences (Choice B).Choice Ais incorrect because genome size is not necessarily proportional to the size of the species. The genome size can vary significantly even among organisms of similar size, and organisms with similar-sized genomes, such as the horse and mouse vary greatly in size.Choice Cis incorrect because it is possible to have a larger genome size with a comparable, or even smaller, number of genes, depending on the amount of non-coding DNA and repetitive sequences present in the genome.

The definition given in the table describes diploidy (2n), which is the standard chromosome number in most sexually reproducing organisms;Choice Aincorrect.Interbreeding between different species can sometimes produce infertile offspring, such as a horse × donkey = mule. This is an example of reproductive isolation because the hybrid offspring is sterile, preventing gene flow between the two species. However, because horses and donkeys are already separate species, this does not result in speciation—it simply reinforces their reproductive barrier. For reproductive isolation to lead to speciation, it must occur within a single species, preventing interbreeding between different populations.Choice Cis incorrect.Mutations are random changes in DNA sequences, not in the amino acid sequence;Choice Dis incorrect.",

This portable technology involves passing a single piece of DNA through a tiny pore in a membrane in an electrical field in a manner such that the current can reveal the DNA sequence.  This allows for the analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA), which consists of DNA fragments shed by organisms into their surroundings (e.g., skin cells, waste).
