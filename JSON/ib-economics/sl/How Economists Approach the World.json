      "markScheme": "\n- $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$:\nEconomics is a social science, and people are unpredictable. As a result, it is not possible for economists to conduct closed system experiments the way that a chemist or physicist might. Therefore, for clarity, economists assume all things not under scrutiny will remain equal or unchanged by the situation being examined.\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Solution}}$:\nFor correctly stating that ceteris paribus means all things equal ($\\checkmark$)\n  For correctly stating that closed experiments are not possible in economics ($\\checkmark$)\n- $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$:\nJohn Maynard Keynes rose to prominence during the Great Depression of the 1930s. He believed that the only way out of this depression, as well as historic or future economic crises, was for the government to spend money through direct investment so businesses could increase supply and give money to citizens to increase demand. He argued that the debt incurred by governments to provide this funding was necessary to avoid economic collapse.\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Solution}}$:\nFor any TWO of the following ($\\checkmark\\checkmark$)\n  \n  - For identifying Keynes’s ideas as a response to the Great Depression\n  - For linking government spending to economic crisis\n  - For linking government stimulus to increased aggregate demand\n  - For linking spending on infrastructure to increased economic output\n\n- $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$:\n  MarxistsKeynesiansEconomic systemplanned economy$\\textcolor{#B2BEB5}{\\textrm{free market economy}}$Response to laissez-faire$\\textcolor{#B2BEB5}{\\textrm{the government makes all economic decisions}}$ $\\hspace{2em}$some government involvement in the economy$\\hspace{2em}$Significance of price$\\hspace{2em}$reflects value of labour used to produce the product$\\hspace{2em}$ $\\textcolor{#B2BEB5}{\\textrm{reflects demand and supply}}$Ownership of factors of production$\\hspace{2em}$public ownership, cooperative companies$\\textcolor{#B2BEB5}{\\textrm{private individuals and corporations}}$\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Solution}}$:\nEconomic system: Marxists argue that the economy should at first be organized by a (socialist) government. Marxists do not embrace free market principles. ($\\checkmark$)\n  Response to laissez-faire: Keynesians advocate for government guidance in some, but not all production. Keynesians support laissez-faire in many sectors of the economy. ($\\checkmark$)\n  Significance of price: Marxists believe prices should reflect the value of the labour used to produce the good or service. Marxists do not believe market forces—demand and supply—effectively establish prices. ($\\checkmark$)\n  Ownership of factors of production: Marxists believe the means of production should be owned by the government in a socialist economy, or by the collective in a fully communist society.
