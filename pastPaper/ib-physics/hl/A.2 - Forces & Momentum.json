      "markScheme": "A\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\nA released marble can cover the same distance in a shorter time when it has greater acceleration. To get greater acceleration, the resultant force downward should be bigger. Three forces are acting on the ball the weight of the ball, buoyancy, and drag. While buoyancy and drag are upwards, weight is downwards. Note that because the marbles are stated to have equal masses, the downwards force of gravity on both marbles is the same.\nThe buoyant force:\n\n\n- $F_b = V\\rho g$\n\nWeight:\n\n\n- $W=mg$\n\nDrag:\n\n\n- $F_d = 6\\pi \\eta rv$\n\nThe resultant force $F_{net}$:\n\n\n- $F_{net}=mg-(V\\rho g+6\\pi \\eta rv)$\n\nBased on the equation above, when the drag force or buoyancy is reduced, the resultant force becomes greater. As the density of the liquid decreases, the magnitude of the buoyant force decreases.\nMoreover, a decrease in diameter directly leads to a decrease in drag force and buoyancy.\nAlternatively, if we consider the terminal velocity, this results when the net force is zero.\nTherefore\n\n\n- $F_g = F_d+F_b$\n- $mg = \\rho V g+6\\pi \\eta rv$\n\nSolving for terminal velocity gives\n\n\n- $v = \\dfrac{mg-\\rho V g}{6\\pi \\eta r}$\n\nSubstituting the fomula for the volume of a sphere\n\n\n- $v = \\dfrac{mg-\\rho (\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3) g}{6\\pi \\eta r}$\n\nWe see that as $r$ increases, the numerator will at some point reach zero. This will be the point at which the density of the marble equals the density of the fluid. We are told that the marble always sinks, and so the numerator must remain positive.\nLooking at the expression, decreasing $r$ will have the effect of both increasing the numerator (thus increasing the velocity) and decreasing the denominator (also increasing the velocity).",

      "markScheme": "D\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\nThe cargo starts with large negative (downward) acceleration. As the cargo container falls, it is speeding up; as it is speeding up, drag force increases, so the acceleration decreases until the cargo container reaches a terminal speed where acceleration is zero. After the parachute is opened, drag force will increase, which is greater than the weight of the cargo container, causing an opposite, upwards, acceleration (deceleration). As the cargo container slows down the drag force decreases, so the net force decreases, and acceleration decreases again until the cargo container reaches a lower terminal speed where acceleration is zero and the forces are balanced.",

Therefore, it is in the same direction as the force of dynamic friction and tension. Instead of the force of dynamic friction with tension only, the resultant force of air friction, tension and the force of dynamic friction balances the component of weight. Hence, the force of dynamic friction would be lower. This would lead to a lower calculated value for coefficient of friction.\n\n",
