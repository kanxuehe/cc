However in its current form we cannot enter it into the calculator as there are too many terms!\nWe need to find a way to rewrite the sum in a simpler form.\nWe can do this by summing the RHS of the equation in two parts. We will let the first $60$ terms be part $A$ and the last $60$ terms be part $B$\nTo find the sum of part $A$ we can use the formula directly, pasrt $A$ has parameters $u1​=2p$, $r=1.0038...$ and $n=60$, therefore\n$$$SA​​=2p(1.0038...)−1(1.0038...)60−1​​A1​$$$\nLet's reconsider the original equation and replace part $A$ with the simpler form found above\n$$$480000k120480000k120​=Bpk119...+pk60​​+A2pk59+2pk58+...+2pk+2p​​=Bpk119...+pk60​​+A2p(1.0038...)−1(1.0038...)60−1​​​​$$$\nPart $B$ is more complicated. We can't simply sum $120$ terms as we only want to sum the last $60$ terms of the sequence.\nLets find the sum of the full $120$ terms and then subtract the sum of the first $60$ terms.\nPart $B$ has parameters $u1​=p$, $r=1.0038...$ and $n=120$, therefore\n$$$SB​​=p(1.0038...)−1(1.0038...)120−1​−p(1.0038...)−1(1.0038...)60−1​​M1A1​$$$\nLet's now rewrite the original equation and replace $SB​$ with the formula above\n$$$480000(1.0038...)120​=Bp(1.0038...)−1(1.0038...)120−1​−p(1.0038...)−1(1.0038...)60−1​​​+A2p(1.0038...)−1(1.0038...)60−1​​​​$$$\nWe can now solve this on the G.D.C.\n$$$pp​=3465.61...=$3466​​A1​$$$\n\n",
