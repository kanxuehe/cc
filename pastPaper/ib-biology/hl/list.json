    "markScheme": "A\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nAsteroids from space, which contained ice, arrived on Earth. This is the most accepted theory for the origin of water on Earth. This theory, often referred to as the \"Late Heavy Bombardment\" theory, suggests that during the early stages of the Solar System's formation, a significant number of asteroids and comets, some of which contained water in the form of ice, bombarded the Earth. Over time, as these icy bodies collided with Earth, they contributed to the accumulation of water on the planet's surface. Choice A is correct.\nChoice B  is incorrect, as water was present on Earth before early organisms were present. Choice C is incorrect because free oxygen atoms were absent in the early atmosphere. Choice D is incorrect because liquid water would need to be present on Earth before it could be converted into steam.",

Hydrated minerals contain water in their crystal structures. Hydrated minerals originating from meteorites can become dehydrated through heating, releasing water vapour into the surroundings and leaving behind anhydrous minerals; Choice D is correct.\nWater molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen atoms, each of which can exist as different isotopes. In planetary science, scientists compare the ratios of these isotopes (such as the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio or the $^{18}O/^{16}O$ ratio) to trace the origin of water.\nChoice A is incorrect because it implies that meteorites contain ice with exactly the same isotopes as those in Earth’s oceans. In reality, all water contains the same possible isotopes, but the key evidence lies in the relative proportions of these isotopes. Some meteorites contain water with a similar isotopic ratio to Earth's oceans, not an identical isotopic composition. Therefore, the claim is misleading.\nCohesion is a process that does not require anything but water molecules, it is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Some evidence of amino acids has been found in meteorites, but no evidence of polypeptides. Choice B is incorrect.\nMeteorites travel through the vacuum of space, where temperatures are far too low to sustain liquid water. Also, no compelling evidence exists that meteorite-bound water has similar salinity to Earth's oceans.; Choice C is incorrect.",

However, water is not good at dissolving non-polar molecules because there is no attraction between water molecules and non-polar molecules. Statement II is therefore not true.\nChoices A, B and D are incorrect as they all include Statement II.",

These minerals incorporate water into their crystal structures (known as water of crystallisation), helping retain water in the Earth's crust before the appearance of life; Choice C is correct.\nHigh heat capacity refers to water’s ability to store heat without large temperature changes, which helps to regulate Earth’s climate, but doesn’t explain why water is retained on Earth; Choice A is incorrect. \nWater is described as a universal solvent as it can dissolve a wide range of substances; however, while water is required for condensation reactions, the process of condensation does not trap water in a manner that would keep it on Earth. Also, biological polymers did not exist until after life emerged. Choice B is incorrect. \nIf water had entered the mantle, the heat there would cause it to evaporate instantly, and therefore, water would not be retained on Earth.

Choice B is the correct answer to this question.\nWhile surface tension is a property of water, it does not directly contribute to the formation of proto-cell membranes (Statement I) in the context of early cellular evolution. Proto-cell membranes are primarily formed by the self-assembly of amphipathic molecules like phospholipids, which align themselves in a bilayer in water due to their hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.\nOrganic molecules needed to remain in suspension for interactions, rather than settling quickly (Statement III).

    "markScheme": "A\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nScientists face significant challenges replicating the exact environmental conditions of early Earth because our understanding of its atmosphere, temperature, pressure, and chemical composition billions of years ago is limited; Choice A is correct.\nThe first cells appeared billions of years ago and are now extinct. Modern cells are descendants but not the original first cells; Choice B is incorrect.\nThere is very limited or no direct fossil evidence of the first protocells because they were microscopic, soft-bodied, and lacked durable structures that fossilise well. The lack, rather than the abundance, of fossil evidence is a key challenge to testing the hypothesis about the origin of the first cells; Choice C is incorrect.\nCurrent scientific understanding strongly supports that protocells contained early forms of genetic material, such as RNA molecules. RNA is believed to have played a dual role as both a genetic material and a catalyst (ribozymes), making it central to hypotheses like the RNA world hypothesis.\nNucleic acids are crucial because they enable self-replication and heredity, essential for the evolution of life. Choice D contradicts the accepted hypotheses and is therefore incorrect.",

Natural selection is driven by random mutations that may or may not benefit an organism; Choice A  is incorrect.

In aqueous conditions, fatty acids can spontaneously form bilayers ($\\checkmark$), which can then close into spherical vesicles, creating a compartment that minimises hydrophobic interactions ($\\checkmark$).\n  These vesicles played a crucial role in protocell development by providing compartmentalisation, allowing for the concentration of reactants and the formation of early metabolic pathways ($\\checkmark$). The selective permeability of vesicle membranes enabled the controlled exchange of nutrients and waste, an essential step for cellular evolution ($\\checkmark$). Additionally, vesicles had the ability to grow and divide, a process resembling primitive cell division, which was crucial for the emergence of life ($\\checkmark$).

    "markScheme": "C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nMulticellular organisms are comprised of numerous specialised cells, enabling them to achieve larger sizes compared to unicellular organisms. This results in them needing exchange systems, such as the circulatory and respiratory systems, to manage waste removal and to acquire essential substances such as oxygen and nutrients. In contrast, unicellular organisms can rely on simple diffusion. Choice C  is correct.\nChoice A  is incorrect because although multicellular organisms often have a larger body size than unicellular organisms, this can be advantageous to them. Choice B  is incorrect, as multicellular organisms adapting to their environment more easily is an advantage. Choice D  is incorrect, as cell differentiation, where cells become specialised for specific functions, is an advantage as it allows for the division of labour amongst cells.",

Since photosynthesis takes place within chloroplasts, these cells contain a high density of chloroplasts They also contain a large central vacuole, which occupies the space at the center of the cell and helps maintain the turgor pressure in the cell. The position of the central vacuole ensures the chloroplasts will be pushed near the edges of the cell, where they can receive light. Additionally, the vacuole acts as a storage reservoir for water and other nutrients needed for photosynthesis.\nChoice A and Choice D are incorrect because mitochondria are the site of aerobic respiration, during which carbohydrates are broken down to produce ATP.

The plant is animal-pollinated (the flower has large petals and internal reproductive structures (stigma and anthers), indicating animal pollination). It also has more than 10 stamens and an ovary that is taller than it is wide. This takes us to step 4. From the diagram on the right, we can see that the flower has fewer sepals than petals which means it must be plant T.\nChoice A is incorrect because the flower in the diagram is animal-pollinated as it has anthers and a stigma held inside the large, colourful petals.\nStep 2: The image only shows half the flower, which has 11 stamens visible. This means the full flower has more than eleven stamens; Choice B is, therefore, incorrect.\nChoice D is incorrect because, in step 3, the ovary is taller than it is wide, so it can't be flower R.",

This means two populations might look different but still interbreed, or might appear similar but already be reproductively isolated. Because divergence doesn’t follow a fixed pattern, deciding when to define them as separate species becomes subjective.\nStatement II is true because Populations might develop noticeable differences in traits (such as colouration or mating calls), but still produce fertile offspring when they interbreed. According to the biological species concept, they’re technically the same species, but these differences can confuse classification.\nStatement III is false because often, the opposite is true. Genetic differences (mutations, allele frequency changes) may accumulate before any visible morphological change occurs. For example, two populations may look identical but carry distinct genetic markers and be reproductively isolated.\nSaying morphological change “always” comes first is incorrect and overly simplistic.\nChoice A is correct because it includes only the two true Statements I and II.\nChoices B, C and D are incorrect as they include the false Statement III.",

Its sequence differs enough between species to allow clear differentiation, yet it remains consistent within individuals of the same species. This makes it highly effective for DNA barcoding.\nChoice A is incorrect: If the cytochrome oxidase I gene were too highly conserved (i.e., nearly identical across species), it wouldn’t provide enough variation to distinguish one species from another.\nChoice C is incorrect. The cytochrome oxidase I gene is not exclusive to animals; it is found in the mitochondria of many eukaryotes. Its utility for animal barcoding comes from its pattern of variability, not its exclusivity.\nChoice D is incorrect. The cytochrome oxidase I gene is mitochondrial, not nuclear, and its evolutionary rate is moderate rather than extremely rapid.

Although marbled crayfish produce genetically identical offspring, this does not make classification impossible; it just means the biological species concept (which relies on interbreeding) isn’t applicable. Other species concepts can be used.\nStatement II is true. The biological species concept defines species based on their ability to interbreed and produce fertile offspring, with reproductive isolation preventing gene flow between different species. However, it does not apply to organisms that reproduce exclusively asexually.\nStatement III is false. The number of offspring does not affect the applicability of the biological species concept. The issue is the absence of sexual reproduction, not the offspring count.\nChoice A is correct because it contains only the true statement and none of the false ones.\nChoice B is incorrect because it contains the false Statement III.\nChoice C is incorrect because it contains the false Statement I.\nChoice D is incorrect because it contains the false Statements I and III.",

    "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nMolecular clock dating uses the genetic differences between species to estimate their times of divergence. This method relies on the assumption that mutations accumulate at a relatively constant rate over time. By comparing the DNA sequences of different organisms, scientists can estimate how long ago their last common ancestor lived. Choice B is, therefore, correct.\nRadioactive dating is a method used to date rocks and other materials based on the known decay rates of radioactive isotopes. Choice A is, therefore, not correct.\nComparative anatomy involves comparing the structures of different organisms to understand their evolutionary relationships. While it can provide evidence of common ancestry and evolutionary trends, it does not offer a precise method for estimating the time of divergence between species based on genetic differences. Choice C is, therefore, not correct.\nStudying the distribution of fossils within sedimentary rock layers establishes relative ages and the chronological order of geological and evolutionary events. Whilst it is essential for constructing the timeline of life on Earth, it does not use genetic differences to estimate divergence times between species. Choice D is, therefore, not correct.",

To determine evolutionary rates, both sequence similarity and known divergence times are needed.\nChoice C is incorrect because the lowest sequence similarity (50%) between human and zebrafish suggests the longest time since divergence, not the most recent.\nChoice D is incorrect because differences in sequence similarity alone cannot demonstrate variation in molecular clock rates.

    "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nSexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes from two individuals, resulting in offspring with a combination of genetic material. This process increases genetic variation, which is essential for evolution and natural selection. Choice B is the correct answer.\nPolyploidy occurs when an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes (e.g., triploid 3n, tetraploid 4n). The definition given in the table describes diploidy (2n), which is the standard chromosome number in most sexually reproducing organisms; Choice A incorrect.\nInterbreeding between different species can sometimes produce infertile offspring, such as a horse × donkey = mule. This is an example of reproductive isolation because the hybrid offspring is sterile, preventing gene flow between the two species. However, because horses and donkeys are already separate species, this does not result in speciation—it simply reinforces their reproductive barrier. For reproductive isolation to lead to speciation, it must occur within a single species, preventing interbreeding between different populations.

    "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice B is correct because adaptive radiation refers to the rapid diversification and speciation of a single ancestral species into multiple descendent species, taking advantage of different niches within a community. Choice A is incorrect as natural selection refers to organisms with advantageous traits having a greater chance of survival and so a greater chance to reproduce and pass on those traits to future generations within that population, leading to the evolution of species over time.  Choice C is incorrect as it refers to the phenomenon where an organism changes in response to new environmental conditions through natural selection and random mutations, while adaptive radiation involves the rapid evolution of more than one species from a single ancestral species.

    "markScheme": "C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nAllopolyploidy arises from hybridisation between two different species, followed by chromosome doubling. The key point is that it introduces a new set of chromosomes from a different species rather than simply doubling an existing diploid genome.\nIn contrast, autopolyploidy occurs within a single species and results in an exact doubling (or higher multiple) of its own chromosome set.  Choice C is, therefore, the correct answer.\nChoice A is incorrect because hybrid vigour is often a direct result of allopolyploidy. New alleles are introduced into a species, giving an immediate selective advantage to that plant species.\nChoice B is incorrect because allopolyploidy allows new varieties that are well adapted to different local abiotic and biotic conditions. This characteristic can explain the widespread global cultivation of wheat (Triticum aestivum) as a staple crop.\nChoice D is incorrect because the new alleles brought in from new species allow a species to compete in a territory or habitat that it had not otherwise been successful in, allowing an invasive species to outcompete the native species in many cases.",

    "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice B is correct because speciation through polyploidy is common in smartweed; if the resulting chromosome number is odd (here 3n), then the plants will become reproductively isolated from the 2n population, even though they are in the same geographic location. This is, therefore, an example of polyploidy and sympatric speciation.\nChoice A is incorrect because, although bonobos and chimpanzees were geographically isolated from each other (allopatric speciation), there was no increase in the chromosome number during the speciation event.  Choice C is incorrect because the lava fields geographically isolated the tortoises, leading to sub-species forming. This is, therefore, an ongoing allopatric speciation event, not sympatric, and it does not involve polyploidy. The tetraploid frog resulted from a polyploidy speciation event that resulted in reproductive isolation. This did not involve spatial separation, so cannot be regarded as allopatric speciation; therefore, Choice D is also incorrect.",

    "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice B is correct because both Lamarckism and epigenetic inheritance propose that environmental factors can cause inherited changes, while Lamarckism suggested these changes were permanent and led to evolution through traits acquired during an organism's lifetime. Epigenetic changes involve reversible chemical modifications to DNA or histone proteins that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. These epigenetic changes can be passed to offspring, but often only persist for a few generations and typically do not lead to long-term evolutionary change.\nChoice A is incorrect because neither Lamarckism nor epigenetic inheritance involves changes to the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetics modifies gene expression through chemical tags, while Lamarckism assumed physical or behavioural changes were inherited.\nChoice C is incorrect because only Lamarckism proposed that the use or disuse of traits directly causes evolutionary change. Epigenetic inheritance does not involve the use or disuse of structures but rather chemical changes to gene regulation influenced by environmental factors.

Sometimes reproductive isolation in both sexually and asexually reproducing species is brought about by a change in chromosome copy number ($\\checkmark$).  This is often due to abnormal meiotic divisions ($\\checkmark$).  When an odd number of chromosomes is present ($\\checkmark$) in the daughter species, for example, 3n, meiosis is impossible ($\\checkmark$), and the daughter species can only reproduce asexually through mitosis.

Genetic diversity is the genetic variability within a species or population. Species diversity is the number and relative abundance of species found in a specific area. Therefore Choice C is correct.\nChoice A is incorrect because genetic diversity does not only refer to the type of alleles in a population but the number of different alleles in a population. Choice B  is incorrect because phenotypic variation refers to differences in observable characteristics, not genetic diversity, and the definition of ecosystem diversity shown in row B is actually the definition for species diversity. Choice D  is incorrect as genetic diversity does not relate to the control of the expression of genes (epigenetics) within a population and the variety of all life on Earth is the definition for biodiversity.",

    "markScheme": "D\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice D is correct because the transfer of ex-situ to in-situ means the return of species from captivity to areas that could become their natural habitats again. Nature reserves increase the chances of successful re-introduction, although many other measures would have to be taken to ensure success. \nChoice A is incorrect because building more captive breeding areas will not increase the chances of being able to reintroduce species back into the wild. \nChoice B is incorrect because, whilst artificial selection would allow desirable traits to be selected for in captivity, this would not necessarily guarantee that species would thrive or even survive in a wild habitat again. Artificial selection would also take a long time (measured in years and decades for some species in particular), as successive generations are bred. \nChoice C is incorrect because having more animals in captivity and plants in botanical gardens would do little to increase the chances of those species being successfully reintroduced to the wild. A large captive population serves no natural purpose to conservation unless a species is released into the wild at some stage. Keeping species in captive breeding might be called ‘preservation’, but it is not ‘conservation’ in its truest sense.",

For example, the felling of trees opens up patches of ground to sunlight, promoting ground-level vegetation ($\\checkmark$). The pools created by beaver dams attract insects ($\\checkmark$) and the consumers (such as birds) that feed on those insects ($\\checkmark$). Dams slow the run-off of rainwater which has a beneficial effect on plant roots which are not washed away by fast-flowing water ($\\checkmark$). The pools also attract fish species and aquatic plants that can oxygenate the pond water ($\\checkmark$); beavers do not eat fish, so there is no harm to the fish from them.\n\n\n\n- the following:\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ total number of different species in the area OR species richness AND  total number of organisms of each species OR species evenness\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\r\n<span class=\"marks\">[<strong>1 mark maximum</strong>]</span>\n\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$: \nTwo measurements needed to calculate Simpson’s Diversity Index are the total number of species in the area and the total number of organisms of each species($\\checkmark$).\n\n\n\n- the following:\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ percentage increase = {(final volume - initial volume)/initial volume} $\\times$ 100%\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\r\nOR {(0.81-0.51) / 0.51} $\\times$ 100%\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ 58.8%   (allow numbers between 52 and 64%) <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\r\n<span class=\"marks\">[<strong>2 marks maximum</strong>]</span>\n\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$: \nPercentage increase = {(p.81$-$0.51) / 0.51} x 100% ($\\checkmark$)\n  = $-$58.8% ($\\checkmark$)\n\n\n\n- any three of the following:\r\n$\\ce{ -> }$ hunting for fur OR castoreum\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ habitat destruction OR the draining of wetlands OR other hydrological changes\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ deforestation OR logging OR increase in agricultural land\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ water pollution\t\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ fragmentation of landscape\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ urbanisation  OR industrial development OR road construction\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ introduction of alien species\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ trade OR travel leading to introduction of disease\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ use of pesticides OR herbicides OR agricultural chemicals\t<span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\r\n<span class=\"marks\">[<strong>3 marks maximum</strong>]</span>\n\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$: \nThe extinction of beavers in the UK may have been caused by overhunting for their valuable fur and castoreum ($\\checkmark$), combined with extensive habitat destruction due to the draining of wetlands ($\\checkmark$) and deforestation for agricultural expansion ($\\checkmark$).
