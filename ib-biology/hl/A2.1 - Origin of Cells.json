      "markScheme": "BExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:When lipids are mixed with water, they spontaneously form bilayers because the hydrophobic tails of the lipids interact with each other, and the hydrophilic heads interact with the water. This leads to the formation of a lipid bilayer, which is the structure of a vesicle. This is a spontaneous process driven by the amphipathic nature of the lipid molecules. Therefore,Choice Bis correct.The membrane around the vesicle is not a monolayer of phospholipids (Choices AandC) because the hydrophilic phosphate heads of the outer layer naturally point outwards into the surrounding aqueous solution, while the heads of the inner layer point inwards to the aqueous contents. The fatty acid tails are hydrophobic, not hydrophilic (Choices AandC), and they align in the centre of the bilayer to minimise exposure to water.Additionally, vesicles are not induced to form in this context (Choices CandD) since the amphipathic nature of phospholipids leads to their self-assembly into bilayers, making external input or induction unnecessary.",

In Pasteur's experiment, the broth in flask X, which had a swan neck, remained clear because the swan neck prevented dust and airborne microbes from reaching the broth while still allowing air to pass through. The dust and microbes were trapped in the bends of the swan neck and did not contaminate the broth.Statement II is true. Flask Y was sterilised and then sealed. The absence of microbial growth in this sealed environment supports the idea that microorganisms are not spontaneously generated from the broth but must be introduced from an external source.Statement III is not true. Pasteur's experiment showed that microbial growth occurred when the swan neck of flask Z was broken off, exposing the previously sterilised broth to the air without any barrier. This demonstrated that microorganisms in the air were responsible for the growth in the broth, not spontaneous generation.As only Statement II is true, answer choice B is the correct answer to this question.",

It also provideschemical defenceagainst pathogens by havingsebaceous glandsthatsecrete sebum, whichlowersthepHof the skin and soinhibitsthegrowthofbacteriaandfungion the skin (✓\\checkmark✓). Mucous membranes line the internal surfaces of some organs and body cavities and secrete mucus, which cantrap pathogens(✓\\checkmark✓). The mucus is thenexpelledby the body orswallowed(✓\\checkmark✓).anyfourof the following:→\\ce{ -> }​steeper the concentration gradient, the greater the rate of diffusion, allowing for faster movement of molecules from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration[1]→\\ce{ -> }​inhaled air in alveoli has a higher concentration of oxygen than oxygen-depleted blood in the capillaries surrounding the alveoliORblood has a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than the air in the alveoli.[1]→\\ce{ -> }​concentration gradients facilitate diffusion of oxygen from alveoli into bloodORcarbon dioxide from blood into alveoli, which provides cells with oxygen for respiration and removes waste carbon dioxide[1]→\\ce{ -> }​large network of capillaries surrounding alveoli rapidly transport oxygen away from the lungsORrapidly transport carbon dioxide from the body to the lungs[1]→\\ce{ -> }​the processes of inhalation and exhalation ensure that there is a constant flow of air in and out of lungs[1]→\\ce{ -> }​chemoreceptors in carotid arteryORaortaORmedulla monitor blood pH levelsORblood carbon dioxide concentrations[1]→\\ce{ -> }​chemoreceptors send signals to respiratory centre in medulla oblongata OR brain stem[1]respiratory centreORmedulla oblongata controls breathing rateORdepth of breathing to maintain concentration gradient of oxygen[1][4 marks maximum]Sample answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}Sample answer​:Efficient gas exchange in the lungs relies on maintaining concentration gradients, whereinhaled airin thealveolihas ahigher concentrationofoxygenthanoxygen-depleted bloodand alower concentrationofcarbon dioxide than that inthe surroundingcapillaries(✓\\checkmark✓). This gradient allowsoxygentodiffuse fromthealveoliinto thebloodandcarbon dioxide fromtheblood intothealveoli(✓\\checkmark✓). An extensivenetwork of capillariessurrounding the alveoli rapidlytransports oxygen awayfrom thelungsandcarbon dioxide tothe lungs (✓\\checkmark✓).

Additionally, thesequencein whichfossils appear in rock layersmatches the sequence in which they would beexpected to evolve(✓\\checkmark✓). For example,olderorganisms are found indeeper layersof rocks, while morerecently evolved organismsare found in theupper layers(✓\\checkmark✓). There are also fossils of extinct organisms withtransitional features, such as Archaeopteryx, a bird-like dinosaur, which supports the hypothesis that birds evolved from reptiles and providesevolutionary linksbetween present and extinct species (✓\\checkmark✓). However, there aregapsin the fossil record (✓\\checkmark✓), some species appear not to havechanged over long periods of time(✓\\checkmark✓), andconvergent evolutioncan make it difficult to track evolution accurately (✓\\checkmark✓).A quality mark is awarded if each part of the question (a, b, c) is answered to earn at least half of the points available, answers do not require re-reading to be understood, and there are almost no errors and little irrelevant information.",
