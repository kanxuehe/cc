      "content": "Celtic Sounds is a popular Irish music festival held annually in a different town or rural location each year across Ireland. The festival celebrates traditional and contemporary Irish music, attracting thousands of tourists, both domestic and international, who travel to experience the vibrant performances, local culture, and scenic settings.\nThe arrival of the festival often brings significant economic benefits to the host area. Local hotels, restaurants, pubs, and shops typically report a substantial increase in trade during the festival period. Additionally, the event raises the profile of small towns and rural communities, encouraging future tourism.\nHowever, not all local residents and businesses are supportive. The festival often leads to road closures, traffic congestion, and disruptions to everyday business activities. Some shops, particularly those not involved in hospitality or tourism, have complained about restricted customer access and the additional costs of adjusting to the temporary surge in visitors. Despite the economic benefits, there is an ongoing debate each year about whether the positives outweigh the negatives for the host locations.\n\n- Define the term stakeholder. [2]\n\n- Explain one reason the interests of local residents and festival organisers might conflict. [2]\n\n- Outline possible different interests of two external stakeholders arising from the Celtic Sounds Festival. [4]\n\n\n[Maximum 8]\n",

      "content": "Explain why a shareholder and a supplier may have a conflict. [4]\n",
      "markScheme": "Some reasons for conflict between shareholders and suppliers:\n\n- Profit Maximisation vs Cost Reduction: Shareholders often seek to maximise profits and returns on their investments in the company. On the other hand, suppliers aim to maintain their revenue and profit margins.\n- Payment Terms: Shareholders may prefer longer payment terms to improve the company's cash flow and bottom line, as this delays the outflow of funds. However, suppliers generally prefer shorter payment terms, as it helps them maintain a consistent cash flow.\n- Quality vs Cost: Shareholders may focus on cost control and profitability, often pushing for lower-priced materials or services. Suppliers, on the other hand, may emphasise the importance of maintaining the quality of goods or services provided.\n- Supply Chain Reliability: Shareholders may seek to diversify the supply chain to mitigate risk, potentially by engaging multiple suppliers. Suppliers, however, prefer exclusivity and consistent orders.\n- Contract Negotiations: Shareholders may expect aggressive contract negotiations with suppliers to secure favourable terms for the company. Suppliers may view these negotiations as overly demanding or unfair, potentially harming their relationship with the company and affecting future cooperation.\n- Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals: Shareholders often have a vested interest in the company's stock performance in the short term. This may lead to a focus on immediate cost reduction, which can conflict with a supplier's perspective that prioritises building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}$:\nShareholders often seek to maximise profits and returns on their investments in the company. This objective may lead them to desire cost-cutting measures, which could include pressuring the management to negotiate lower prices with suppliers. On the other hand, suppliers aim to maintain their revenue and profit margins. Thus, when shareholders push for reduced costs, it can put suppliers in a difficult position, as they may need to make concessions that impact their own profitability.\nShareholders like longer payment terms when the company owes money because this means the company can hold onto its cash for a longer period. Holding onto cash can improve the company's financial position and give it more flexibility. When the company has more cash on hand, it appears healthier and more stable.\nOn the other hand, suppliers prefer shorter payment terms when they sell something. They want to get paid quickly because it ensures they have a steady inflow of cash. This consistent cash inflow is crucial for them to manage their own expenses and keep their operations running smoothly.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each reason.\n2 marks for explaining each reason.\nTotal - 4 marks",

The company went public five years ago and is now listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nGreenTech Innovations' mission is to provide innovative, sustainable energy solutions to address the growing need for clean energy, while their vision is to become a global leader in the renewable energy sector.\nSince becoming a PLC, GreenTech has faced increased pressure from investors to improve profitability and deliver short-term returns. Investors are demanding higher profits and faster growth, which has led to a shift in strategy.\nThe company has faced growing tension between its initial mission of promoting green energy and the increasing pressure to invest in fossil fuel technologies.

Employees, especially those involved in sustainable energy projects, may feel that such a shift compromises the company’s core values of sustainability, causing dissatisfaction among staff who are passionate about environmental goals.\n- Another conflict could arise between customers and investors/shareholders. Customers who are loyal to GreenTech's environmentally sustainable mission may be disappointed if the company expands into fossil fuel sectors to meet the profit demands of investors.

The pressure from investors for higher short-term returns might be satisfied if the company diversifies into the fossil fuel sector.

These groups help JKR succeed by contributing to its operations, supporting eco-friendly practices, and guiding regulatory compliance.\n  Mark allocation:\n  Award [1] for partial understanding.\nAward [2] if the candidate understands that stakeholders are individuals/groups with an interest, impact, and are affected, and provides evidence from the case study.\nApplication is required as the business name is in the question.\n- Sample response:\n  One internal stakeholder of JK Recycling Ltd. (JKR) is its employees. Employees are crucial to JKR's success, ranging from the management team, which drives strategic initiatives, to the operational staff, who ensure efficient processing of recycled materials. They are directly involved in the day-to-day operations and decision-making processes, impacting the company's performance and growth.\n  JKR's external stakeholder is the local community. The local community is vital in promoting recycling practices and providing recyclable plastic. They support JKR by participating in recycling programs and advocating for environmental sustainability. Their engagement helps increase the supply of recyclable materials and enhances JKR's reputation as an eco-friendly company, driving its mission towards a sustainable future.\n  Mark allocation:\n  Mark as 2 + 2\n  Award [1] for stating a valid internal/external stakeholder and an additional [1] for application to the case study.\nAward a maximum of [4].\n- Sample response:\n  The new government incentives have led to an increasing volume of materials being recycled,resulting in workers working at full capacity.While this is great for increasing revenue, it can easily lead to conflict between management and employees if the employees feel they are being pushed too hard without adequate compensation, breaks, or additional staffing.\n  As JKR's operations increase due to higher recycling volumes, there's a potential for negative impacts on the local communities. This could include increased noise from machinery, more frequent truck traffic, or even perceived issues with waste management or odors. A significant increase in activity could lead to protests or complaints from local residents. This could clash with JKR's operational need to expand and process more materials to meet demand.\n  Mark allocation:\nMark as 2 + 2\n  Award [1] for stating a identifying a  relevant cause of stakeholder conflict  and an additional [1] for application to the case study.\nAward a maximum of [4].\n- Sample response:\nThe government acts as a crucial stakeholder for JKR by setting the regulatory framework and providing incentives that directly impact the recycling industry. They establish laws, policies, and offer financial benefits (like the improved recycling incentives mentioned) that shape JKR's operations, profitability, and the overall volume of materials available for recycling.\n  Mark allocation:\n  Award [1] for identifying a relevant role of government  and an additional [1] for application to the case study.\nAward a maximum of [2].\n",
