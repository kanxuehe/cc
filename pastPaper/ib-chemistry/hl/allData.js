The sloped regions show cooling within a phase, where particles lose kinetic energy and the temperature falls. The flat regions represent phase changes, when temperature remains constant because the energy released is due to intermolecular forces being formed.\nThe long plateau near $78^\\circ\\text{C}$ corresponds to condensation. Gas particles must come close together and form many new intermolecular forces, releasing a large quantity of energy to the surroundings. The shorter plateau near $-114^\\circ\\text{C}$ corresponds to freezing, where fewer forces are formed as the liquid arranges into the solid structure, so less energy is released.  Condensation takes longer than freezing as more heat must be removed.\nOnly condensation and freezing are represented here. Sublimation (solid to gas) or deposition (gas to solid) do not occur under these conditions and are not shown.',

Because these two regions differ in composition, the contents of the flask constitute a heterogeneous mixture, not a homogeneous one.  Statement I is false.\nFilter paper will trap the undissolved crystals, yet the dissolved sucrose passes through together with the water, so filtration cannot separate the mixture completely.  This limitation makes statement II true.\nEvaporating the liquid phase would drive off the water and leave all of the sugar behind, but the water itself would not be collected unless a condenser were attached.  Thus evaporation, as described, does not recover the water, rendering statement III false.\nThis question is categorized as medium difficulty as students must distinguish homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures. In addition, they should reflect on the extent of two separating methods, filtration and evaporation.',

The residue on the filter paper contains sand and iron, while the sodium chloride solution passes through as the filtrate.\nTo recover both water and sodium chloride from the filtrate, simple distillation is used. During distillation, water is collected as the distillate and sodium chloride remains in the flask.

Instead of fixed paths, electrons exist in probability clouds called orbitals, where their exact location cannot be determined. These orbitals are described by quantum mechanics, where electrons behave more like waves than particles in fixed orbits. Therefore, the idea of electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets is an outdated model that does not accurately describe atomic structure.",

Without this force, the protons would repel each other due to their positive charges. On the other hand, electrostatic attraction is responsible for keeping negatively charged electrons bound to the positively charged nucleus. This force is much weaker than the strong nuclear force but is crucial for maintaining atomic structure. Contrary to one of the incorrect options, gravitational forces are negligible at the atomic scale, and the strong nuclear force does not play a role in keeping electrons attached to the nucleus.',

A continuous spectrum is not restricted to certain wavelengths, rather all wavelengths are possible.\n  - Since the lines are discrete and represent electron jumps between energy levels, this shows us that the energy levels are quantized. $\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    The hydrogen emission spectrum is a line spectrum that only contains certain wavelengths of light. The lines represent an electron releasing energy as it drops to a lower energy level, equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels. In order for the lines to be discrete, the conclusion must be made that energy levels are quantized.\n\n',

The arrow must begin at $n = 2$ and point to $n = 5$ to indicate the direction of the transition.\n  - Energy must be absorbed for the electron to move away from a position closer to the nucleus ($n = 2$) to a position further from the nucleus ($n = 5$).

These energies correspond to the difference between allowed energy levels in the atom. When atoms absorb those photons, the electrons are excited to higher energy levels, and the absorbed wavelengths are missing from the observed spectrum, creating dark lines.\nSome answers might seem tempting but are incorrect. For example, photons are not emitted when electrons are excited because energy must be absorbed for an electron to move to a higher level. Likewise, when electrons fall to lower energy levels, they emit photons, which is how emission spectra are formed. Suggesting that photons are absorbed while electrons fall is inaccurate, since falling to a lower energy level releases energy rather than requiring it.',

      "C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\nThe student must deduce the corresponding group of elements X and Y from the successive ionization energies given. An element's successive ionization energies increase as more energy is needed to remove electrons.  As the ion becomes more positive, it will take more energy to remove the next electron.  Successive ionization energies always increase. When the next electron is in a shell closer to the nucleus, the successive ionization energy will increase sharply because there is less shielding of the nuclear charge and because the distance between the electron and nucleus is smaller.\nIn the table provided, the largest jump in the ionization energy for element X occurs between $IE_1$ (first ionization energy) and $IE_2$ (second ionization energy). This must correspond to a change in energy level. So, the atom of the element must have one valence electron and belong to group 1. In the case of Y, the largest jump in the ionization energy occurs between $IE_6$ (sixth ionization energy) and $IE_7$ (seventh ionization energy). So, the atom of the element must have six valence electrons and belong to group 16.\nX forms cations with one positive charge whereas Y forms ions with two negative charges. As a result, the combination of $\\ce{X+}$ and $\\ce{Y^{2-}}$ is $\\ce{X2Y}.$\nThis question is categorized as a medium as the student must use the information from successive ionization energies to deduce the corresponding group for the elements and then figure out how these are combined together.",

However, the data also show irregularities that can only be explained by sublevels. The first occurs between magnesium and aluminium: in aluminium, the electron removed is from a $3p$ orbital, which lies at slightly higher energy and is shielded by the inner 3s orbital. This makes it easier to remove than the $3s$ electron in magnesium. A second dip occurs between phosphorus and sulfur. Phosphorus has three unpaired $3p$ electrons, but sulfur has a fourth $3p$ electron that must pair with one of the others. The repulsion between two electrons in the same orbital lowers the energy required to remove one, creating the observed decrease. These two dips are direct experimental evidence that period 3 contains both $3s$ and $3p$ sublevels.\n  - Ar has highest effective nuclear charge , same shielding $\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\nArgon lies at the end of period 3, where the nuclear charge is greatest. Its outer electrons are still in the $n=3$ shell, but they experience a strong effective nuclear charge because shielding from inner electrons is relatively constant across the period. This strong attraction between nucleus and outer $3p$ electrons requires much more energy to remove them, so argon shows the highest first ionization energy of period 3.\n\n',

A pressure of 200 atm would be consistent with the pressure in a compressed gas cylinder when the gas is in liquid form, and is therefore not behaving as an ideal gas.',

      "C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation:}}$\nAt constant temperature, an ideal gas obeys Boyle's law, so the product  $PV = \\textrm{constant}.$ When $V$ is plotted against\n$P,$ the curve must therefore be a  hyperbola because volume decreases inversely as pressure increases. If instead $\\frac{1}{V}$ is plotted against $P,$ the two quantities are directly proportional and produce a straight line through the origin. Finally, a plot of $PV$ vs. $P$ should be a horizontal line, since\n$PV$ does not change with pressure for an ideal gas at fixed temperature.\nFor ideal gases:\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/2e328213-b8b3-4d4b-8e08-001a02815f7c/images/c4710df2-772b-4aba-993e-dc6c21b2d238/CH1226hyperbola.png)\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/2e328213-b8b3-4d4b-8e08-001a02815f7c/images/0583432a-e106-4649-84a9-1df1388166c9/Screenshot%202025-09-23%20at%202.20.38%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/2e328213-b8b3-4d4b-8e08-001a02815f7c/images/93ce3c7f-1dfb-48a0-96ed-91708dd0f328/CH1226PVvsPideal.png)\n\n\nThis question is categorized as hard as students must predict the shape of the curve for the relationship between pressure and volume in an ideal gas at a constant temperature.",
