These orbitals are described by quantum mechanics, where electrons behave more like waves than particles in fixed orbits.

Without this force, the protons would repel each other due to their positive charges. On the other hand, electrostatic attraction is responsible for keeping negatively charged electrons bound to the positively charged nucleus. This force is much weaker than the strong nuclear force but is crucial for maintaining atomic structure. Contrary to one of the incorrect options, gravitational forces are negligible at the atomic scale, and the strong nuclear force does not play a role in keeping electrons attached to the nucleus.",
