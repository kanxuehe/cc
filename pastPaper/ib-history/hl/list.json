The Chinese Government has in various ways invoked action on the part of foreign governments, citing its reliance upon treaty obligations and inviting special reference to the Kellogg Pact.\r\n\n\nThis situation is of concern, morally, legally and politically to a considerable number of nations. It is not exclusively a matter of concern to Japan and China. It brings into question at once the meaning of certain provisions of agreements, such as the Nine Powers Treaty of February 6, 1922, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.\r\n\n\nThe American Government is confident that it has not been the intention of the Japanese Government to create or to be a party to the creation of a situation which brings the applicability of treaty provisions into consideration. The American Government does not wish to be hasty in formulating its conclusions or in taking a position. However, the American Government feels that a very unfortunate situation exists, which no doubt is embarrassing to the Japanese Government. It would seem that the responsibility for determining the course of events with regard to the liquidating of this situation rests largely upon Japan, for the simple reason that Japanese armed forces have seized and are exercising de facto control in South Manchuria.\r\n\n\nIt is alleged by the Chinese, and the allegation has the support of circumstantial evidence, that lines of communication outward from Manchuria have been cut or interfered with.

The Japanese Government made several decisions during these two years that exacerbated the situation. Unable or unwilling to control the military, Japan's political leaders sought greater security by establishing the $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” in August, 1940. In so doing they announced Japan's intention to drive the Western imperialist nations from Asia. However, this Japanese-led project aimed to enhance Japan' economic and material wealth so that it would not be dependent upon supplies from the West, and not to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$liberate” the long-subject peoples of Asia. In fact, Japan would have to launch a campaign of military conquest and rule, and did not intend to pull out of China. At the same time, several pacts with Western nations only made Japan appear more of a threat to the United States. First, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy on September 27, 1940 and thereby linked the conflicts in Europe and Asia. This made China a potential ally in the global fight against fascism. Then in mid-1941, Japan signed a Neutrality Pact with the Soviet Union, making it clear that Japan's military would be moving into Southeast Asia, where the United States had greater interests. A third agreement with Vichy France enabled Japanese forces to move into Indochina and begin their Southern Advance. The United States responded to this growing threat by temporarily halting negotiations with Japanese diplomats, instituting a full embargo on exports to Japan, freezing Japanese assets in U.S. banks, and sending supplies into China along the Burma Road. (...)\r\n\n\nFaced with serious shortages as a result of the embargo, unable to retreat, and convinced that the U.S. officials opposed further negotiations, Japan's leaders came to the conclusion that they had to act swiftly. For their part, U.S. leaders had not given up on a negotiated settlement, and also doubted that Japan had the military strength to attack the U.S. territory. Therefore they were stunned when the unthinkable happened and Japanese planes bombed the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.\n[Source: Japan, China, the United States and the Road to Pearl Harbor, 1937-41.

Should Britain, in return for half-hearted French support of the half-hearted British policy of half-heartedly pretending to restrain Italian aggression in Africa, promise to fulfill the obligations of the Covenant and of Locarno against Germany? Paris desired such a pledge and was willing to pay for it by going as far as necessary with Britain in “coercing” Italy, so long as both understood that Il Duce [Mussolini] must not be alienated or confronted with any serious risk of defeat. London was unwilling to assume any definite commitments vis-à-vis the Reich even after France and other States had pledged defense of Britain against a hypothetical Italian attack. This pledge was quite safe: all knew there would be no Italian attack. There would be no effective sanctions which would provoke attack. The British and French leaders had no desire to make sanctions effective and thereby jeopardize Italian prospects of victory.\r\n[Schuman, Frederick L.

This gives the source great value as it reflects the perceptions of someone living through the immediate crises of the 1930s.\n- Schuman's purpose is to critique the diplomatic ineptitude of Britain and France in addressing the Italian and German threats.

His emphasis on $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$half-hearted\" policies highlights the core weaknesses of international diplomacy in the period.\n\nFor limitations, any of the following:\n\n- The source's publication date, 1939, can also limit its perspective (origin) as Schuman's analysis lacks the hindsight that later historians would have, potentially missing broader historical patterns or developments that became clear only after the war began.\n- Schuman's critical stance may lead to an overly negative portrayal of their actions, potentially ignoring the broader context of why appeasement policies were adopted, such as economic difficulties and public opposition to another war.\n- Schuman's emphasis on their $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$half-hearted\" efforts may downplay other diplomatic considerations, such as the economic constraints and domestic political pressures that influenced their policies.

Schuman's proximity to the events allows for an authentic and immediate critique of the diplomatic tensions, particularly between Britain, France, and Italy. ($\\checkmark$ VO) His purpose of critically analysing the failures of Britain and France in restraining Italian aggression and addressing the German threat provides valuable insight into the growing frustration with appeasement policies at the time ($\\checkmark$ VP). Additionally, the source's content, which emphasizes the reluctance of Britain and France to act decisively, sheds light on the ineffective diplomatic strategies that contributed to the failure of collective security in the 1930s ($\\checkmark$ VP).\nHowever, the source also has limitations, particularly because Schuman wrote it in 1939, before the full consequences of these diplomatic decisions were fully understood ($\\checkmark$ LO). Schuman's purpose of condemning the indecisiveness of the European powers risks oversimplifying their decisions, as it neglects to fully consider the economic constraints and public opinion against war, which were significant factors behind appeasement ($\\checkmark$ LP). Furthermore, the content focuses narrowly on the diplomatic failures of Britain and France, without taking into account the broader international context, such as the roles of the United States or the Soviet Union, which limits the source's ability to provide a complete picture of the diplomatic landscape ($\\checkmark$ LC).",

The article seeks to justify Chamberlain's appeasement policy.As a central figure in British politics during a tumultuous decade—first as Chancellor of the British Exchequer from 1931-1937, then as Prime Minister—Chamberlain had to address a complex of problems that reached well beyond a revived Germany and a ranting dictator. Britain faced threats across the globe: Germany in Europe, Italy in the Mediterranean, and, perhaps most troubling of all, Japan in Asia and the Pacific. A war with any one of those three surely would lead the other two to horn in on British territories or possessions. Notions that Chamberlain did not comprehend the threat Germany posed or that appeasement constituted moral cowardice on his part or that Winston Churchill was the only figure on Britain’s political scene calling for rearmament and a hard line against Hitler—all standard to the anti-Chamberlain dossier—oversimplify history to the point of falsity.\r\n\n\nIn the late 1930s, just about every important figure in British government, and/or at least the Conservative Party, knew that it was time to spend on national defense. In November 1933, 10 months after Hitler seized power, the British cabinet created a committee on defense requirements to study the cost of military modernization and how long the process would take. That planning culminated in early 1935 in a $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$White Paper.” The findings? Even if rearmament began immediately, Britain would not be ready to fight Germany until 1939. The analysis described weapons not yet in production, some of them only prototype sketches. The $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Thirty-Niners,” as rearmament advocates were called, realized wishes took time to become reality, and that until then the thing to do was negotiate, buy time, and avoid a new war. And so, from 1935 on, Britain was in a juggling act: trying to appease Hitler, but also feverishly girding for an inevitable war. In that context, Chamberlain's much-maligned policy, distasteful as it appears, made some sense. Engaging Hitler in talks and turning a cheek to his invective gained Britain time to man up. Chamberlain probably did feel his actions might make war unnecessary, and even if he failed he could say—as he did on September 1, 1939—that he acted $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$with a clear conscience.”\r\n\n\nBy then Britain was ready to fight—or at least far readier than a year before. $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Last September we might have lost a short war,” Lieutenant General Henry Pownall, the army's chief planner, wrote at the time. “Now we shouldn't, nor a long one either.”[Source: Citino, R.

Source 2 mentions that Britain would benefit from a delay of 6-12 months to improve defenses against Germany's air power. Similarly, Source 3 emphasizes that Britain was targeting 1939 for readiness, as rearmament took years to reach effective levels..\n- Each source acknowledges the military danger posed by Germany. Source 2 discusses Germany’s potential to enhance its power and threaten France and Britain directly, while Source 3 indicates that British leaders viewed Germany as part of a global threat matrix that required careful attention.\n- Both sources suggest that rearmament was tied to appeasement. In Source 2, military buildup is linked to buying time against a possible German attack, while Source 3 indicates that appeasement was seen as a way to delay conflict until Britain was ready to confront Germany militarily.\nFor contrast, any of the following differences:\n- Source 2 views delaying a confrontation with Germany as a short-term tactic, suggesting a 6-12 month window for Britain to strengthen defenses. In contrast, Source 3 presents appeasement as a longer-term approach to buy time until full readiness by 1939, considering it necessary due to global commitments.\n- Source 2 focuses narrowly on the immediate military threat posed by Germany and specifically discusses the impact of Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia on European security. Source 3, however, discusses Britain's broader geopolitical challenges, including threats from Italy and Japan, showing that British priorities extended beyond Europe.\n- Source 2 does not mention Chamberlain directly, nor does it justify appeasement; it primarily discusses the military advantages of postponing conflict. In contrast, Source 3 explicitly defends Chamberlain's policy, arguing that his approach made sense given Britain's military limitations and that he was actively preparing Britain for a likely war.\n<span class=\"marks\">[6 marks maximum]</span>\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$:\r\n\nBoth sources highlight that time was essential for Britain to build up its military strength before any possible conflict with Germany ($\\checkmark$ similarity). In Source A, there's an emphasis on the benefit of even a short delay, suggesting that an additional 6-12 months would help Britain catch up in air defenses against Germany. Similarly, Source B reflects the need for time, indicating that Britain required several years of preparation to reach a state of readiness by 1939 ($\\checkmark$ evidence) Additionally, both sources show a shared understanding that Germany posed a serious threat to Britain ($\\checkmark$ similarity). Source A underscores the risk of Germany gaining a stronger military foothold in Europe, while Source B situates Germany as part of a broader set of threats facing Britain, reflecting a recognition of the country's growing danger ($\\checkmark$ evidence).However, the sources differ in how they view the role of appeasement. Source 2 presents delay as a short-term, tactical response to give Britain some additional time, while Source 3 depicts appeasement as a longer-term strategy to strengthen British defenses over multiple years, aiming for sustained readiness by 1939 ($\\checkmark$ difference $\\checkmark$ evidence). Another difference lies in the scope of threats each source addresses. Source 2 is focused on Germany's actions in Europe, particularly in Czechoslovakia, as a primary concern. In contrast, Source 3 places Germany within a global context, showing that British officials were also concerned with threats from Italy and Japan, which required careful balancing of resources across multiple regions ($\\checkmark$ difference $\\checkmark$ evidence).",

Then the British government entered on its policy of reprimanding Mussolini severely, but the words were not followed by acts.\r\n\n\nIn summing up the Abyssinian story it must be stated that neither Britain nor France was ignorant of the ultimate aims of Mussolini; yet they not only did nothing to help Abyssinia, but rather prevented her from acquiring the necessary arms for defense, in the hope that Mussolini's friendship could thus be bought. He was assisted, also, by the long diplomatic conferences which he knew meant nothing. To be sure, at one time he feared that public opinion in England might demand the closing of the Suez Canal, but he need not have worried, since the British government had no intention of hindering him. The sanctions passed by the League were not carried out. Oil sanctions were solemnly discussed by various committees of nineteen and thirteen and committees of experts, but Mussolini threatened that if an oil embargo were declared he would fight. Just how he could have dared fight Britain and France and the other League members combined was never explained, but the bluff worked. No oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini. By use of gas and airplanes against a practically unarmed people Mussolini was able to subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence. The abortive sanctions and the reprimands of the British government and press were deeply resented by Mussolini who has never forgotten these $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$insults\" to Italian honor.\r\n\n\nOn May 2, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie left Abyssinia and the Italians announced that they had obtained another great addition to their colonial empire. On May 9, from a balcony at the Palazzo Venezia, the Duce delivered a speech of defiance and proclaimed the king of Italy, emperor of Abyssinia. Adowa was avenged.\r\n\n[Source: Maxwell, Bertram Wayburn (1939). International Relations. HathiTrust Digital Library. Retrieved November 1, 2024 from https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.$b589970.

On July 31, 1935, two months before Italian troops invaded Ethiopia, he wrote in the Popolo d'Italia that $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$the Italian-Ethiopian problem admitted of only one solution-with Geneva, without Geneva, against Geneva.\" On the very day that Italian soldiers crossed the Ethiopian frontiers, Baron Aloisi declared in Geneva that Italy acted in defense against Ethiopian aggression, and that Ethiopia was therefore guilty of a breach of the Covenant, and not Italy.\r\n\n\nWhen it seemed for a time that the League was serious about stopping Italy from continuing her war of conquest and began to impose sanctions against Italy, Mussolini wrote in the Popolo d'Italia of January 31, 1936, that $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$If the satanic oppression of the imperialists and of the bloodthirsty sects of Europe have their own way, Europe will inevitably fall into the most unjustified and terrible war that humanity has ever seen.\"\r\n\n\nIn these words the fear of resolute League action was still discernible. The sanctions, however, proved ineffective because the League did not dare to impose the only sanction, the oil embargo, which would have brought the Fascist government to reason. Mussolini threatened that Italy would leave the League if it dared to execute faithfully the provisions of the Covenant, and the League backed down. Six months later Mussolini told an audience at Milan on November 1, 1936, that the League must either renew itself or perish, and $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$as it is difficult to see how it can renew itself, as far as we are concerned it can tranquilly perish.\" In November, 1937, Italy formally announced her withdrawal from the League.\r\n\n[Source: Ebenstein, William.

Finally, both sources discuss the role of a potential oil embargo on Italy during the crisis ($\\checkmark$ similarity). Source B says that because $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$no oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini” Italy was able to use gas and airplanes to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence\" and source D says, $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$the League did not dare to impose the only sanction, the oil embargo, which would have brought the Fascist government to reason\" ($\\checkmark$ evidence).\nSource B discusses the British policy of appeasing Mussolini and the Hoare Laval pact which is not mentioned in Source D ($\\checkmark$ difference).
