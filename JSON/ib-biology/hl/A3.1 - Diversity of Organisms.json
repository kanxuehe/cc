Choice D is not a true statement, and so is the correct answer.\nThe genome is all the genetic information of an organism, including the genes and non-coding DNA. In humans, the genome is organised into linear chromosomes in the nucleus, and circular chromosomes in the mitochondria. Choice A is a true statement and so an incorrect answer. Organisms of the same species have most of their genome in common; however, variations give rise to some diversity between individuals. Choice C is a true statement and so an incorrect answer. Each cell in a multicellular organism typically contains a full copy of the genome, including liver cells, an exception is red blood cells as they do not have a nucleus.

Over time, as species diverge and evolve, mutations accumulate in their base sequences. The longer two species have been separated from their common ancestor, the more mutations will have accumulated in their genomes. Therefore, species that are closely related have fewer accumulated mutations and more similar base sequences (Choice B).\nChoice A is incorrect because genome size is not necessarily proportional to the size of the species. The genome size can vary significantly even among organisms of similar size, and organisms with similar-sized genomes, such as the horse and mouse vary greatly in size. Choice C is incorrect because it is possible to have a larger genome size with a comparable, or even smaller, number of genes, depending on the amount of non-coding DNA and repetitive sequences present in the genome. Humans have a larger genome but a similar number of genes to the chimpanzee, mouse and horse. Choice D is incorrect because there is a difference of one nucleotide base in the table between humans and chimpanzees. The genome of humans and chimpanzees is similar but not the same.",

It also relies on the ability to see species interbreeding, which cannot be done with extinct species or fossils ($\\checkmark$). The morphological concept defines a species as a group of organisms with shared traits, however, due to variation caused by reproductive isolation and mutation, not all members of a species look the same ($\\checkmark$).

The plant is animal-pollinated (the flower has large petals and internal reproductive structures (stigma and anthers), indicating animal pollination). It also has more than 10 stamens and an ovary that is taller than it is wide. This takes us to step 4. From the diagram on the right, we can see that the flower has fewer sepals than petals which means it must be plant T.\nChoice A is incorrect because the flower in the diagram is animal-pollinated as it has anthers and a stigma held inside the large, colourful petals.\nStep 2: The image only shows half the flower, which has 11 stamens visible. This means the full flower has more than eleven stamens; Choice B is, therefore, incorrect.\nChoice D is incorrect because, in step 3, the ovary is taller than it is wide, so it can't be flower R.",

      "markScheme": "A\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nStatement I is true because, during speciation, some traits (e.g., behaviour, physiology, morphology) can evolve faster than others. This means two populations might look different but still interbreed, or might appear similar but already be reproductively isolated. Because divergence doesnât follow a fixed pattern, deciding when to define them as separate species becomes subjective.\nStatement II is true because Populations might develop noticeable differences in traits (such as colouration or mating calls), but still produce fertile offspring when they interbreed. According to the biological species concept, theyâre technically the same species, but these differences can confuse classification.\nStatement III is false because often, the opposite is true. Genetic differences (mutations, allele frequency changes) may accumulate before any visible morphological change occurs. For example, two populations may look identical but carry distinct genetic markers and be reproductively isolated.\nSaying morphological change âalwaysâ comes first is incorrect and overly simplistic.\nChoice A is correct because it includes only the two true Statements I and II.\nChoices B, C and D are incorrect as they include the false Statement III.",

This process increases genetic variation, which is essential for evolution and natural selection. Choice B is the correct answer.\nPolyploidy occurs when an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes (e.g., triploid 3n, tetraploid 4n). The definition given in the table describes diploidy (2n), which is the standard chromosome number in most sexually reproducing organisms; Choice A incorrect.\nInterbreeding between different species can sometimes produce infertile offspring, such as a horse Ã donkey = mule. This is an example of reproductive isolation because the hybrid offspring is sterile, preventing gene flow between the two species. However, because horses and donkeys are already separate species, this does not result in speciationâit simply reinforces their reproductive barrier. For reproductive isolation to lead to speciation, it must occur within a single species, preventing interbreeding between different populations.

Its sequence differs enough between species to allow clear differentiation, yet it remains consistent within individuals of the same species.

The cytochrome oxidase I gene is not exclusive to animals; it is found in the mitochondria of many eukaryotes. Its utility for animal barcoding comes from its pattern of variability, not its exclusivity.\nChoice D is incorrect. The cytochrome oxidase I gene is mitochondrial, not nuclear, and its evolutionary rate is moderate rather than extremely rapid.

      "markScheme": "A\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nStatement I is false. Although marbled crayfish produce genetically identical offspring, this does not make classification impossible; it just means the biological species concept (which relies on interbreeding) isnât applicable. Other species concepts can be used.\nStatement II is true. The biological species concept defines species based on their ability to interbreed and produce fertile offspring, with reproductive isolation preventing gene flow between different species. However, it does not apply to organisms that reproduce exclusively asexually.\nStatement III is false. The number of offspring does not affect the applicability of the biological species concept. The issue is the absence of sexual reproduction, not the offspring count.\nChoice A is correct because it contains only the true statement and none of the false ones.\nChoice B is incorrect because it contains the false Statement III.\nChoice C is incorrect because it contains the false Statement I.\nChoice D is incorrect because it contains the false Statements I and III.",
