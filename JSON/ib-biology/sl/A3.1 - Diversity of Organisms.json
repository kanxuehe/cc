Choice D is not a true statement, and so is the correct answer.\nThe genome is all the genetic information of an organism, including the genes and non-coding DNA. In humans, the genome is organised into linear chromosomes in the nucleus, and circular chromosomes in the mitochondria. Choice A is a true statement and so an incorrect answer. Organisms of the same species have most of their genome in common; however, variations give rise to some diversity between individuals. Choice C is a true statement and so an incorrect answer. Each cell in a multicellular organism typically contains a full copy of the genome, including liver cells, an exception is red blood cells as they do not have a nucleus.

      "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nSpecies that share a recent common ancestor, such as humans and chimpanzees, are more likely to have similar base sequences. Over time, as species diverge and evolve, mutations accumulate in their base sequences. The longer two species have been separated from their common ancestor, the more mutations will have accumulated in their genomes. Therefore, species that are closely related have fewer accumulated mutations and more similar base sequences (Choice B).\nChoice A is incorrect because genome size is not necessarily proportional to the size of the species. The genome size can vary significantly even among organisms of similar size, and organisms with similar-sized genomes, such as the horse and mouse vary greatly in size. Choice C is incorrect because it is possible to have a larger genome size with a comparable, or even smaller, number of genes, depending on the amount of non-coding DNA and repetitive sequences present in the genome. Humans have a larger genome but a similar number of genes to the chimpanzee, mouse and horse. Choice D is incorrect because there is a difference of one nucleotide base in the table between humans and chimpanzees. The genome of humans and chimpanzees is similar but not the same.",

Prokaryotic chromosomes are looped, while eukaryotic chromosomes are linear ($\\checkmark$).\n  Similarities and differences between autosomes and sex chromosomes: \nBoth autosomes and sex chromosomes are made of DNA and contain genes. Autosomes are chromosomes that do not determine sex and do not have genes for sex-linked characteristics; sex chromosomes determine sex and have genes for sex-linked traits. There is one pair of sex chromosomes in a somatic nucleus, but there can be more than one pair of autosomes ($\\checkmark$) in a somatic nucleus. X and Y chromosomes are of different lengths, while autosomal homologous chromosome pairs are equal in length ($\\checkmark$) \nComparing non-homologous chromosomes and homologous chromosomes:\nHomologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes that have genes for the same characteristics and can have the same or different alleles. Non-homologous chromosomes have genes for different characteristics ($\\checkmark$).\n  \n\nA quality mark is awarded if each part of the question (a, b, c) is answered to earn at least half of the points available, answers do not require re-reading to be understood, and there are almost no errors and little irrelevant information. <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n",

      "markScheme": "A\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nStatement I is true because, during speciation, some traits (e.g., behaviour, physiology, morphology) can evolve faster than others. This means two populations might look different but still interbreed, or might appear similar but already be reproductively isolated. Because divergence doesn’t follow a fixed pattern, deciding when to define them as separate species becomes subjective.\nStatement II is true because Populations might develop noticeable differences in traits (such as colouration or mating calls), but still produce fertile offspring when they interbreed. According to the biological species concept, they’re technically the same species, but these differences can confuse classification.\nStatement III is false because often, the opposite is true. Genetic differences (mutations, allele frequency changes) may accumulate before any visible morphological change occurs. For example, two populations may look identical but carry distinct genetic markers and be reproductively isolated.\nSaying morphological change “always” comes first is incorrect and overly simplistic.\nChoice A is correct because it includes only the two true Statements I and II.\nChoices B, C and D are incorrect as they include the false Statement III.",

Choice B is the correct answer.\nPolyploidy occurs when an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes (e.g., triploid 3n, tetraploid 4n). The definition given in the table describes diploidy (2n), which is the standard chromosome number in most sexually reproducing organisms; Choice A incorrect.\nInterbreeding between different species can sometimes produce infertile offspring, such as a horse × donkey = mule. This is an example of reproductive isolation because the hybrid offspring is sterile, preventing gene flow between the two species. However, because horses and donkeys are already separate species, this does not result in speciation—it simply reinforces their reproductive barrier. For reproductive isolation to lead to speciation, it must occur within a single species, preventing interbreeding between different populations.

Due to the overlapping ranges in the number of genes, it is entirely possible for chickens to have a greater number of genes than humans (Statement II).

Heterogeneity within the tumour can provide clinicians and researchers with crucial clues for determining the most effective treatment options ($\\checkmark$).\n\n\n\n- any two of the following (must include one benefit and one risk):\n  benefits\n$\\ce{ -> }$ enables rapid identification of pathogens in remote or resource-limited areas\t <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ faster response time for public health interventions\t <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ tracking of endangered OR invasive OR elusive species by eDNA without the need for lab facilities\t <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ identification of species present in an ecosystem based on eDNA without the need for lab facilities  <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ genetic analysis at the point of care OR on-site for rapid treatment response\t <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ individual empowerment OR accountability over their own health\t <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ increased speed of identification of criminal suspects OR disaster victims\t <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  risks\n$\\ce{ -> }$ privacy concerns due to easy access to genetic data\t <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ misuse of genetic information OR genetic discrimination \t <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ misinterpretation of results by non-experts may lead to incorrect medical or legal decisions\t <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ potential for higher error rate  <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ potential for bioterrorism   <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  $\\ce{ -> }$ technological advancements moving faster than legal regulatory framework leads to misuse and abuse <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n\n  <span class=\"marks\">[<strong>2 marks maximum</strong>]</span>\n\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$: \nOne potential benefit of portable DNA sequencing is that it can provide faster results ($\\checkmark$) because the sequencing can be done on-site rather than sent to a lab, which can take days.

It can also identify conserved genes or regulatory sequences between species ($\\checkmark$).  Whole-genome sequencing can contribute to personalised medicine through the identification of genetic diseases ($\\checkmark$) and predispositions to disease, as well as probable individual physiological responses to treatment options ($\\checkmark$).\n",
