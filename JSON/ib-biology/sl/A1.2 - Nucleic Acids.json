On the other side of the nucleotide,the phosphate group is bonded to the 3’ carbon sugar(✓\\checkmark✓) of another nucleotide through a condensation reaction. Both bonds arecovalent bonds(✓\\checkmark✓). Repeated alternating sugar-phosphate bonds form the sugar-phosphate backbone.  The1’ carbon of the sugar is covalently bonded to the nitrogenous base(✓\\checkmark✓)also through a condensation reaction to make up one complete nucleotide.DNA is a double helix(✓\\checkmark✓) in which nitrogenous bases form the centre of the structure, andboth strands are held together by hydrogen bonds(✓\\checkmark✓) between the complementary bases from each strand.A pairs up with T, and C always pairs up with G(✓\\checkmark✓).A quality mark is awarded if each part of the question (a, b, c) is answered to earn at least half of the points available, answers do not require re-reading to be understood, and there are almost no errors and little irrelevant information.[1]",

At the melting point, the DNA double helix separates into two individual strands.Two DNA samples were compared, one consisting of only PQ pairs and another one consisting of only RS pairs.  Letters P, Q, R and S represent different nitrogenous bases found in the DNA.\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/d59dd324-98c9-4e4e-91b6-758d5679701c/images/0881eea3-e69e-45cc-ad3b-7c9e377763b5/BI0321.png)\n\n[ © Revision Village 2022]Based on the results presented in the graph, and your knowledge of nucleotide base pairing (between purines and pyrimidines), deduce which nitrogenous bases correspond to the letters P, Q, R and S.\\hspace{2.5em}P\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{2.5em}Q\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{2.5em}R\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{2.5em}S\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{1.5em}A.\\hspace{1.5em}CytosineGuanineThymineAdenine\\hspace{1.5em}B.\\hspace{1.5em}AdenineCytosineGuanineThymine\\hspace{1.5em}C.\\hspace{1.5em}GuanineAdenineThymineCytosine\\hspace{1.5em}D.\\hspace{1.5em}ThymineAdenineCytosineGuanine",
      "markScheme": "DExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Adenine pairs up with thymine and cytosine pairs up with guanine. Hence, PQ or RS would either be adenine with thymine or cytosine with guanine (Choices AandD), but definitely notChoices BorC.Cytosine and guanine pairing has three hydrogen bonds, whereas the adenine and thymine pairing has only two hydrogen bonds. At95oC95^oC95oC, there is a smaller percentage of RS-rich DNA melted content compared to PQ-rich DNA.This shows that RS would be cytosine and guanine pairing (Choice D) and PQ is adenine and thymine. Because the extra hydrogen bond between C and G makes it more temperature resistant compared to A and T.",
