      "content": "Urban Fresh is a family-owned supermarket chain in the UK, founded by Sarah Roberts and her brother Tom Roberts. The company focuses on providing high-quality, locally sourced produce at affordable prices. Over the years, Urban Fresh has gained a loyal customer base by offering fresh, organic, and sustainable food options, along with excellent customer service that emphasizes personal attention and community values.As competition grows from larger supermarket chains like SuperValue and FreshMart, Urban Fresh has decided to shift its focus towards expanding its market share by opening new stores in untapped cities and introducing a line of ready-to-eat meals targeted at busy professionals. The marketing department conducted a survey of customers to determine their main reason to buy convenience meals.Figure 1: Top reasons for buying ready-to-eat meals\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/223f0a6e-ad9b-4afa-a3ff-ec0963afc4c9/images/033ff15f-9860-4be7-b6cd-0e11a77b0b6c/Screenshot%202025-07-21%20at%2014.27.12.JPEG)\n\nUrban Fresh’s mission statement is to provide innovative, sustainable food solutions by offering fresh, organic, and affordable products to help customers live healthier lives. Their vision is to become the leading supermarket in the UK for sustainable and ethically sourced food by 2030.In addition to expanding, Urban Fresh is aiming to become more sustainable by reducing its carbon footprint, with the goal of sourcing 100% of its produce from local farms by 2025.

Urban Fresh’s mission to provide innovative, sustainable food solutions ensures all stakeholders, from employees to customers, understand the company’s values. It serves as a guide for decision-making and strategy.One disadvantage is that a mission statement can sometimes be too broad or vague, making it difficult to translate into specific goals.

They provide a sense of direction and purpose but are not specific or measurable.Objectives: Objectives are specific, measurable, and time-bound targets that a business sets to achieve its aims. They are more detailed and actionable.Below are some key differences of Aims and Objectives:AimsAims are usually open-ended and do not have specific details or deadlines attached to them.Aims are not easily measurable since they are broad and qualitative.Aims often have an indefinite or long-term time frame and may not have a fixed deadline.Aims encompass the overall vision and purpose of the business and may involve multiple aspects of the organisation.Aims provide the overarching vision and strategic direction, helping to align the organisation's efforts.An aim for a business might be to“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“become a market leader in the industry”\\text{\\textquotedblright}”without specifying how or when.Aims set the overall direction and purpose for the business but, on their own, do not ensure success.ObjectivesObjectives are highly specific and have clear criteria, such as deadlines, quantities, or percentages.Objectives are measurable because they are defined with specific, quantifiable criteria that allow progress tracking.Objectives have a defined time frame, typically short- to medium-term, and are time-bound.Objectives are more focused and deal with particular aspects or functions of the business.Objectives serve as actionable steps toward realising the aims and are critical for strategic planning and decision-making.Objectives related to the above aim could include“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“increase market share by10%10\\%10%within the next two years”\\text{\\textquotedblright}”or“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“launch a new product line by the end of the fiscal year.”\\text{\\textquotedblright}”Objectives are the actionable steps that, when achieved, contribute directly to the business's success by fulfilling the aims.Sample response‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}Sample response​:Aims and objectives represent two fundamental components in the strategic planning of a business. Aims, the broader and more abstract of the two, serve as the overarching vision and long-term goals of the organisation. They provide a sense of direction and purpose, helping to align the efforts of the business towards a common goal. However, it's essential to recognise that aims lack specificity and measurability. These goals are often open-ended, lacking specific details or deadlines. For instance, an aim for a business might be the ambition to“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“become a market leader in the industry.”\\text{\\textquotedblright}”While this is undoubtedly a big aspiration that provides a sense of direction, it does not contain the specific criteria necessary for measurement, nor does it stipulate a deadline for its achievement.In contrast, objectives are the practical, specific, and measurable steps that a business puts in place to realise its aims. Objectives are designed to be actionable and serve as the bridge between the broad aspirations encapsulated in aims and the practical implementation required for success. These objectives are characterised by their high level of specificity and measurability. For example, if the aim is to become a market leader, objectives may include“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“increase market share by 10% within the next two years”\\text{\\textquotedblright}”or“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“launch a new product line by the end of the fiscal year.”\\text{\\textquotedblright}”Objectives are often set with clear criteria, such as deadlines, quantities, or percentages, making it possible to track progress and determine success.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each difference.2 marksfor explaining each difference.Total- 4 marks",

It is a declaration of the fundamental purpose of an organisation's existence and its core values.A vision statement is inspirational and usually abstract. The statement is not about targets that need to be achieved but projects a vision of what can be accomplished. A vision statement inspires and binds the employees, owners and stakeholders together.A mission statement is specific and action-oriented. It outlines the principles of the organisation and sets a framework for how managers and employees operate to achieve its goals.A vision statement is inspirational and motivates employees and stakeholders by creating an environment of unity and commitment through a shared sense of purpose and direction.A mission statement is about the organisation's actions and focuses on execution during daily operations. It outlines the action to achieve its objectives and guides the decision-making process. A mission statement, though qualitative, should be clearly defined and achievable.A characteristic of vision statements is that they are stable and relevant in the long term. They can be refined from time to time, but the core message is consistent with the timeless values and goals of the organisation.On the other hand, a mission statement is frequently adjusted to suit changes in the business environment, including market conditions and trends. An organisation's priorities can change over time, and the mission statement needs to be adjusted to remain relevant.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each difference.2 marksfor explaining each difference.Total- 4 marks",

Ethical objectives, defined by an organisation's moral guidelines and societal norms, play a pivotal role in shaping decision-making and can significantly influence the business's performance.One of the key advantages of having ethical objectives is the substantial improvement in the corporate image. When a company adheres to strong ethical principles, it is viewed more favourably by customers, employees, and the public. This positive perception can lead to increased trust, loyalty, and support from customers, resulting in a boost to the brand's reputation. A strong corporate image not only enhances market competitiveness but also paves the way for long-term sustainability. It is also noteworthy that improved corporate image often translates into higher profitability, as ethical businesses are more likely to attract a larger customer base.However, there are disadvantages as the implementation of ethical standards and practices can come with compliance costs, as businesses must allocate resources for ethical training, monitoring, and ensuring adherence to these standards. These costs can strain a company's financial resources, potentially leading to reduced short-term profits. In addition to compliance costs, adhering to stringent ethical standards may require changes to business processes and operations, which may not always align with short-term profitability objectives. This presents a complex dilemma for businesses as they navigate between the pursuit of ethical goals and the need to remain financially viable.In essence, while ethical objectives can enhance a company's corporate image and long-term sustainability, they may require financial sacrifices and present challenges for businesses in the short term.Mark Allocation:2 Marks: Identification of impacts (e.g., enhanced reputation, customer loyalty, operational challenges, etc.).2 Marks: Explanation of how these impacts influence the business (e.g., ethical practices attract socially conscious customers, increase costs, improve employee satisfaction, etc.).Total- 4 marks",

CSR is subjective and based on public opinion, which differs from country to country or from time to time.

Organisations commit to ethical behaviour towards all stakeholders and their communities. This commitment includes considering the interest and fair treatment of employees, suppliers and customers.An organisation with the reputation of being considerate has a favourable advantage in the eyes of stakeholders and customers.Awareness of environmental damage and the urgency of preventing further deterioration has grown in the past few decades. A feature of CSR is that ecological considerations guide the decision-making process, and due care is taken to ensure business activities do not cause any damage to the environment. Organisations engage in green initiatives to reduce their ecological impact through using renewable energy, recycling, and reducing emissions.Many customers prefer patronising organisations known to follow environmentally sustainable practices.A key feature of CSR is engaging in local communities and participating in their development. Organisations set aside budgets to support charities and help with social causes. They donate funds and allocate resources to help alleviate social and humanitarian issues.Philanthropy is essential in enhancing an organisation's reputation in the eyes of customers and stakeholders, thus giving it an advantage over competitors.CSR confirms an organisation's transparency culture by disclosing information concerning their activities' social and environmental impact. Organisations publish reports disclosing their goals and initiatives in their drive towards sustainability and community development and often monitor compliance and progress in meeting their CSR goals.An organisation known to be transparent and honest in its dealing with environmental and social issues is looked upon favourably and trusted by customers, stakeholders and investors.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each feature.2 marksfor explaining each feature.Total- 4 marks",
