These lines represent wavelengths of light that are emitted when an electron jumps between energy levels. As electrons move further from the nucleus, the energy levels become closer in energy so the energy difference decreases and the lines are closer together and converge.\n  - In a continuous spectrum, all wavelengths are possible. In a line spectrum, only certain wavelengths are possible. $\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    In the hydrogen emission spectrum, only certain wavelengths of light equal to the energy difference between two energy levels are possible, forming a line spectrum. A continuous spectrum is not restricted to certain wavelengths, rather all wavelengths are possible.\n  - Since the lines are discrete and represent electron jumps between energy levels, this shows us that the energy levels are quantized. $\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    The hydrogen emission spectrum is a line spectrum that only contains certain wavelengths of light. The lines represent an electron releasing energy as it drops to a lower energy level, equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels. In order for the lines to be discrete, the conclusion must be made that energy levels are quantized.\n\n",

      "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\textrm{\\underline{Explanation:}}$\nDark lines in an absorption spectrum are caused by electrons in atoms absorbing photons of specific energies. These energies correspond to the difference between allowed energy levels in the atom. When atoms absorb those photons, the electrons are excited to higher energy levels, and the absorbed wavelengths are missing from the observed spectrum, creating dark lines.\nSome answers might seem tempting but are incorrect. For example, photons are not emitted when electrons are excited because energy must be absorbed for an electron to move to a higher level. Likewise, when electrons fall to lower energy levels, they emit photons, which is how emission spectra are formed. Suggesting that photons are absorbed while electrons fall is inaccurate, since falling to a lower energy level releases energy rather than requiring it.",
