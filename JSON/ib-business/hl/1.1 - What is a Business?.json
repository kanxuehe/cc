These loans support women in sectors such as farming, retail, and craft production, giving them the opportunity to generate income, improve their families’ living standards, and become financially independent.Unlike traditional businesses, EmpowHer does not aim to make a profit for shareholders. Instead, all profits are reinvested into the organisation to fund more loans, expand its reach into new communities, and offer financial literacy and business training to its clients.As a non-profit, EmpowHer's management team is focused primarily on achieving its social mission rather than financial targets.
