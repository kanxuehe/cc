      "markScheme": "D\n\n$\\textrm{\\underline{Explanation:}}$\nIsotopes have the same number of protons and electrons, meaning their chemical properties remain identical. This includes their ability to form chemical bonds and react with acids or bases. However, isotopes have different numbers of neutrons, leading to variations in their atomic mass which affects physical properties. In gases, the diffusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic mass (as described by Graham's Law). Lighter isotopes diffuse faster than heavier isotopes, making diffusion rate the key property that differs between isotopes.\nWhile some physical properties vary between isotopes, such as density and melting point, properties like electrical conductivity remain unchanged. Conductivity depends on the movement of free electrons, which is not influenced by the nuclear mass.",
