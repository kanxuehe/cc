For the observer to see the lights turned on, light would have to travel to the observer. Due to the symmetry of the situation, both signals would have to travel through the same distance up to the observer's eyes, this means that the time differencetB−tAt_B-t_AtB​−tA​is the same as the time difference received by the observer.It is then:Δt=tB−tA=1.95×10−6s=1.95μ\\Delta t=t_B-t_A=1.95\\times10^{-6}\\,\\ce{s}=1.95\\,\\muΔt=tB​−tA​=1.95×10−6s=1.95μs",
