Without this force, the protons would repel each other due to their positive charges. On the other hand, electrostatic attraction is responsible for keeping negatively charged electrons bound to the positively charged nucleus. This force is much weaker than the strong nuclear force but is crucial for maintaining atomic structure. Contrary to one of the incorrect options, gravitational forces are negligible at the atomic scale, and the strong nuclear force does not play a role in keeping electrons attached to the nucleus.",

Isotopic abundances differ from one planet to another. The periodic table values are tabulated, considering the isotopic abundances on Earth. As a result, we can suggest that the sample of titanium tested may not belong to Earth.This question is categorized as medium as students must calculate the relative atomic mass from data and understand the nature of tabulated values in the periodic table.",

      "markScheme": "DExplanation:‾\\textrm{\\underline{Explanation:}}Explanation:​Isotopes have the same number of protons and electrons, meaning their chemical properties remain identical. This includes their ability to form chemical bonds and react with acids or bases. However, isotopes have different numbers of neutrons, leading to variations in their atomic mass which affects physical properties. In gases, the diffusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic mass (as described by Graham's Law). Lighter isotopes diffuse faster than heavier isotopes, making diffusion rate the key property that differs between isotopes.While some physical properties vary between isotopes, such as density and melting point, properties like electrical conductivity remain unchanged. Conductivity depends on the movement of free electrons, which is not influenced by the nuclear mass.",
