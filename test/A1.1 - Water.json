      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Statement Iis true because cohesion refers to the attraction between water molecules due to hydrogen bonding. This cohesive property allows the water column to behave as a continuous stream, enabling tension created by transpiration at the leaves to be transmitted all the way down the xylem. This is central to the cohesion-tension theory of water transport.Statement IIis false because cohesion actually resists evaporation. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules make it harder for individual molecules to escape into the air. Evaporation is more closely influenced by temperature and humidity, not directly by cohesion.Statement IIIis true because adhesion is the attraction between water molecules and the walls of the xylem vessel. This helps to counteract gravity and supports the column, reducing the chance of it breaking, especially under tension during transpiration. So this contributes to the integrity of the water column.Choice Cis therefore the correct answer because it only includes the two trueStatements IandIII.Choice Ais incorrect as it is missing the trueStatement III.Choices BandDare incorrect as they include the falseStatement II.",

      "markScheme": "DExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:The oldest meteorites in our solar system have been found to contain ice and hydrated minerals. Hydrated minerals contain water in their crystal structures. Hydrated minerals originating from meteorites can become dehydrated through heating, releasing water vapour into the surroundings and leaving behind anhydrous minerals;Choice Dis correct.Water molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen atoms, each of which can exist as different isotopes. In planetary science, scientists compare the ratios of these isotopes (such as the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio or theX18X2218O/X16X2216O\\ce{^{18}O/^{16}O}X18​X2218​O/X16​X2216​Oratio) to trace the origin of water.Choice Ais incorrect because it implies that meteorites contain ice with exactly the same isotopes as those in Earth’s oceans. In reality, all water contains the same possible isotopes, but the key evidence lies in the relative proportions of these isotopes. Some meteorites contain water with a similar isotopic ratio to Earth's oceans, not an identical isotopic composition. Therefore, the claim is misleading.Cohesion is a process that does not require anything but water molecules, it is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Some evidence of amino acids has been found in meteorites, but no evidence of polypeptides.Choice Bis incorrect.Meteorites travel through the vacuum of space, where temperatures are far too low to sustain liquid water. Also, no compelling evidence exists that meteorite-bound water has similar salinity to Earth's oceans.;Choice Cis incorrect.",

      "markScheme": "AExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Choice Ais correct because water’s ability to absorb and store a significant amount of heat without undergoing large temperature changes provides thermal cushioning.  In summer water absorbs heat energy and then in winter this heat energy is lost to the surrounding air helping to create milder microclimates. This enables the black-throated loon to inhabit areas where temperature might otherwise be too extreme.Choice Bis incorrect because it does not explain how winter air temperatures are made more moderate, only that ice insulates water that is below it which is not where the black-throated loon lives.Choice Cis incorrect because water does not have a low specific heat capacity.Choice Dis incorrect because, although it is a true statement, it does not explain how winter temperatures are made more moderate.",

      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Water is a polar molecule, meaning it has partial positive and negative charges. This polarity allows water to form chemical bonds with rock-forming minerals, leading to hydrated compounds such as gypsum (CaSOX4⋅HX2O\\ce{CaSO_4.H_2O}CaSOX4​⋅HX2​O) and hydrated feldspars. These minerals incorporate water into their crystal structures (known as water of crystallisation), helping retain water in the Earth's crust before the appearance of life;Choice Cis correct.High heat capacity refers to water’s ability to store heat without large temperature changes, which helps to regulate Earth’s climate, but doesn’t explain why water is retained on Earth;Choice Ais incorrect.Water is described as a universal solvent as it can dissolve a wide range of substances; however, while water is required for condensation reactions, the process of condensation does not trap water in a manner that would keep it on Earth. Also, biological polymers did not exist until after life emerged.Choice Bis incorrect.If water had entered the mantle, the heat there would cause it to evaporate instantly, and therefore, water would not be retained on Earth. Water's ability to sink into the mantle would be due to rock porosity and cracks, not its density;Choice Dis incorrect.",

Polar and non-polar substances do not readily mix because water molecules are attracted to each other through hydrogen bonding and other dipole-dipole interactions.

Proto-cell membranes are primarily formed by the self-assembly of amphipathic molecules like phospholipids, which align themselves in a bilayer in water due to their hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.Organic molecules needed to remain in suspension for interactions, rather than settling quickly (Statement III).
