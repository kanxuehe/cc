Then the British government entered on its policy of reprimanding Mussolini severely, but the words were not followed by acts.\r\nIn summing up the Abyssinian story it must be stated that neither Britain nor France was ignorant of the ultimate aims of Mussolini; yet they not only did nothing to help Abyssinia, but rather prevented her from acquiring the necessary arms for defense, in the hope that Mussolini's friendship could thus be bought. He was assisted, also, by the long diplomatic conferences which he knew meant nothing. To be sure, at one time he feared that public opinion in England might demand the closing of the Suez Canal, but he need not have worried, since the British government had no intention of hindering him. The sanctions passed by the League were not carried out. Oil sanctions were solemnly discussed by various committees of nineteen and thirteen and committees of experts, but Mussolini threatened that if an oil embargo were declared he would fight. Just how he could have dared fight Britain and France and the other League members combined was never explained, but the bluff worked. No oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini. By use of gas and airplanes against a practically unarmed people Mussolini was able to subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence. The abortive sanctions and the reprimands of the British government and press were deeply resented by Mussolini who has never forgotten these“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“insults\" to Italian honor.\r\nOn May 2, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie left Abyssinia and the Italians announced that they had obtained another great addition to their colonial empire.

This extract is about the Hoare-Laval Pact of 1935 and its implications.Dissension developed between Paris and London over a wholly different question. Should Britain, in return for half-hearted French support of the half-hearted British policy of half-heartedly pretending to restrain Italian aggression in Africa, promise to fulfill the obligations of the Covenant and of Locarno against Germany? Paris desired such a pledge and was willing to pay for it by going as far as necessary with Britain in “coercing” Italy, so long as both understood that Il Duce [Mussolini] must not be alienated or confronted with any serious risk of defeat. London was unwilling to assume any definite commitments vis-à-vis the Reich even after France and other States had pledged defense of Britain against a hypothetical Italian attack. This pledge was quite safe: all knew there would be no Italian attack. There would be no effective sanctions which would provoke attack. The British and French leaders had no desire to make sanctions effective and thereby jeopardize Italian prospects of victory.[Schuman, Frederick L.

This gives the source great value as it reflects the perceptions of someone living through the immediate crises of the 1930s.Schuman's purpose is to critique the diplomatic ineptitude of Britain and France in addressing the Italian and German threats. This reveals the frustration of contemporary observers with appeasement policies, making the source valuable for understanding contemporary critiques of diplomacy.The source focuses on the diplomatic indecision and half-hearted efforts of Britain and France to address the Italian aggression in Africa and German rearmament. His emphasis on“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“half-hearted\" policies highlights the core weaknesses of international diplomacy in the period.For limitations, any of the following:The source's publication date, 1939, can also limit its perspective (origin) as Schuman's analysis lacks the hindsight that later historians would have, potentially missing broader historical patterns or developments that became clear only after the war began.Schuman's critical stance may lead to an overly negative portrayal of their actions, potentially ignoring the broader context of why appeasement policies were adopted, such as economic difficulties and public opposition to another war.Schuman's emphasis on their“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“half-hearted\" efforts may downplay other diplomatic considerations, such as the economic constraints and domestic political pressures that influenced their policies. It also ignores the role of other states.[4 marks maximum]Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:This source holds significant value as it was written in 1939 by Frederick L. Schuman, a historian offering a near-contemporary analysis of European diplomacy leading up to World War II. Schuman's proximity to the events allows for an authentic and immediate critique of the diplomatic tensions, particularly between Britain, France, and Italy. (✓\\checkmark✓VO) His purpose of critically analysing the failures of Britain and France in restraining Italian aggression and addressing the German threat provides valuable insight into the growing frustration with appeasement policies at the time (✓\\checkmark✓VP). Additionally, the source's content, which emphasizes the reluctance of Britain and France to act decisively, sheds light on the ineffective diplomatic strategies that contributed to the failure of collective security in the 1930s (✓\\checkmark✓VP).However, the source also has limitations, particularly because Schuman wrote it in 1939, before the full consequences of these diplomatic decisions were fully understood (✓\\checkmark✓LO). Schuman's purpose of condemning the indecisiveness of the European powers risks oversimplifying their decisions, as it neglects to fully consider the economic constraints and public opinion against war, which were significant factors behind appeasement (✓\\checkmark✓LP). Furthermore, the content focuses narrowly on the diplomatic failures of Britain and France, without taking into account the broader international context, such as the roles of the United States or the Soviet Union, which limits the source's ability to provide a complete picture of the diplomatic landscape (✓\\checkmark✓LC).",

By so doing we shall have heavily insured ourselves against the greatest danger to which we are present exposed: indeed by substantially reducing Germany’s only chance of a rapid decision, we shall have provided a strong deterrent against her making the attempt.(c) It follows, therefore, that, from the military point of view, time is in our favour, and that, if war with Germany has to come, it would be better to fight her in say 6-12 months' time, than to accept the present challenge.[Source: Ismay, Hastings (20 September 1938) Note to British Cabinet (CAB 21/544).

Then the British government entered on its policy of reprimanding Mussolini severely, but the words were not followed by acts.In summing up the Abyssinian story it must be stated that neither Britain nor France was ignorant of the ultimate aims of Mussolini; yet they not only did nothing to help Abyssinia, but rather prevented her from acquiring the necessary arms for defense, in the hope that Mussolini's friendship could thus be bought. He was assisted, also, by the long diplomatic conferences which he knew meant nothing. To be sure, at one time he feared that public opinion in England might demand the closing of the Suez Canal, but he need not have worried, since the British government had no intention of hindering him. The sanctions passed by the League were not carried out. Oil sanctions were solemnly discussed by various committees of nineteen and thirteen and committees of experts, but Mussolini threatened that if an oil embargo were declared he would fight. Just how he could have dared fight Britain and France and the other League members combined was never explained, but the bluff worked. No oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini. By use of gas and airplanes against a practically unarmed people Mussolini was able to subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence. The abortive sanctions and the reprimands of the British government and press were deeply resented by Mussolini who has never forgotten these“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“insults\" to Italian honor.On May 2, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie left Abyssinia and the Italians announced that they had obtained another great addition to their colonial empire. On May 9, from a balcony at the Palazzo Venezia, the Duce delivered a speech of defiance and proclaimed the king of Italy, emperor of Abyssinia. Adowa was avenged.[Source: Maxwell, Bertram Wayburn (1939).International Relations. HathiTrust Digital Library. Retrieved November 1, 2024 from https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.$b589970.

The negotiations from January to May, 1936, were a repetition of those of November and December, 1935. The object in each case was to eliminate the risk of European war by preventing effective action against Italy, and the method employed was to side-track sanctions by holding out the hope of 'peace by conciliation.' This technique, which had succeeded so well before Christmas, was equally efficacious in the new year and it was still being practised with great dexterity when the termination of the war by a complete Italian victory rewarded the virtuosity of the diplomats and won them a hard-earned rest.During this second phase the task of those who were playing for safety was relatively easy. For the rejection of the Hoare-Laval Plan, which was a victory for the sanctionists, was also the high-water mark of their success. They were unable to follow it up and thenceforth were fighting a losing battle. There were only a small number of people actively conducting the campaign and they depended for support on the large mass of middle opinion, whose influence, although invariably decisive when it operates, is only sporadically exercised. This 'floating vote,' as it is sometimes called, represents the millions of liberal-minded and sentimental English people, who subscribe neither to conservatism or socialism, but who must be captured by any party which aspires to power. At the General Election in November 1935, the 'floating vote' had been cast for the National Government, largely as a reward for its support of the League. In December it swung violently away and forced the Government to repudiate the Hoare-Laval plan and its author. Logically it should have continued to exert pressure in favour of more and better sanctions. But the 'floating vote' is anything but logical; it is emotional, and intellectually lazy, and likes to be bothered with politics as little as possible. It had spent its emotional force in a nation-wide protest; having done that it was quite content to let the Government carry on and do what it thought best about Abyssinia. Its conscience was salved, and it was beginning to be bored with the whole affair.[Source: Martelli, George (1938).Italy Against The World; the first complete impartial account of Italy's repudiation of the League; her conquest of Abyssinia, by an English author with an intimate knowledge of the facts.

Czechoslovakia recedes into the darkness. She has suffered in every respect by her association with the Western democracies and with the League of Nations, of which she has always been an obedient servant. She has suffered in particular from her association with France, under whose guidance and policy she has been actuated for so long...We in this country, as in other Liberal and democratic countries, have a perfect right to principle of self-determination, but it comes ill out of the mouths of those in totalitarian states who deny even the smallest element of toleration to every section and creed their bounds...What is the remaining position of Czechoslovakia? Not only are they politically mutilated, but economically and financially, they complete confusion. Their banking, their railway arrangements, are severed and their industries are curtailed, and the movement of their population is most cruel... It is a tragedy which has occurred....I venture to think that in the future Czechoslovakian state cannot be maintained as an independent entity. You will find that in a period of time measured only by months, Czechoslovakia will be engulfed in the Nazi régime. Perhaps they may join it in despair or in revenge. At any rate, that story is over and told... It is the most grievous consequence which we have yet experienced of what we have done and of what we have left undone in the last five years—five years of futile good intention, five years of eager search for the line of least resistance, five years of uninterrupted retreat of British power, five years neglect of our air defenses. We have been reduced from a position of security, of safety and power—power to do good, power to be generous to a beaten foe, power to make terms with Germany, power to give her proper redress for her grievances, power to stop her arming if we chose, power to take any step in strength or mercy or justice which we thought right—reduced in five years from a position safe and unchallenged to where we stand now.When I think of the fair hopes of a long peace which still lay before Europe at the beginning of 1933 when Herr Hitler first obtained power, and of all the opportunities of arresting the growth of the Nazi power which have been thrown away, when I think of the immense combinations and resources which have been neglected or squandered, I cannot believe that a parallel exists in the whole course of history. So far as this country is concerned the responsibility must rest with those who have the undisputed control of our political affairs. They neither prevented Germany from rearming, nor did they re-arm ourselves in time... They neglected to make alliances and combinations which might have repaired previous errors, and thus they left us in the hour of trial without adequate national defense or effective international security...We are in the presence of a disaster of the first magnitude... Do not let us blind ourselves to that. It must now be accepted that all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will make the best terms they can with the triumphant Nazi Power…[Source: Churchill, W. (5 October 1938).

Henderson has been described by historians as a supporter of appeasement.It is no exaggeration to say that the world is awaiting with anxiety the message which Hitler has to deliver at Nuremberg. He cannot get out of delivering it: that must be realised. The anxiety is no less great in Germany than elsewhere. And dictators can & must speak more clearly than the leaders of a democracy, that is why I have been pressing these last weeks for a clarification before Nuremberg of the situation at Prague. Benes (President of Czechoslovakia) will never go far enough till he is made to do so: & the whole of the Carlsbad points is better than any terms he is likely to get later, war or no war.I suppose the chances of Hitler coming out at Nuremberg with what will amount to peace or what will amount to war (thunder there is sure to be) are about 50-50.  I opt for the former.  If I am right I do wish it might be possible to get at any rate the Times, Camrose (Owner of the Daily Telegraph), Beaverbrook (Owner of Daily Express) Press etc to write up Hitler as an apostle of Peace.  It will be terribly shortsighted if this is not done.  Cannot the News Dept help?We make a great mistake when our Press persists in abusing him.  Let it abuse his evil advisers but give him a chance of being a good boy.  If our object is to achieve results that is the only line to take.

His position allows historians to understand the perspectives and recommendations of a senior diplomat actively involved in Britains policy of appeasement.The purpose of the source, to advise the British government on handling Hitler through positive media portrayal, provides valuable insight into the strategies employed in appeasement. It reveals a preference for influencing Hitler diplomatically rather than through confrontation, which is crucial for understanding British efforts to avoid war.The content of the source, suggesting that the British press avoid criticizing Hitler and instead focus on presenting him positively, is valuable as it captures the British diplomatic mindset at the time. It illustrates the hope that diplomatic gestures might encourage Hitler toward peace, offering insight into appeasement strategies.For limitations, any combination of the following:As an ambassador, Henderson's perspective may reflect his personal biases and diplomatic objectives, which could skew his assessment. His views might not represent the entire British government's stance, making it a limited source for understanding broader British policy beyond his own pro-appeasement viewpoint.The purpose is also a limitation, as it reflects an attempt to sway government and press strategy rather than an objective analysis of Hitler's intentions.

His suggestion to avoid criticizing Hitler directly may overlook the true extent of Hitler's aggression, thus potentially downplaying the risks of appeasement for contemporary historians.[4 marks maximum]Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:The origin of this source, written by Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, is valuable because Henderson had firsthand experience with Nazi officials and was deeply involved in British-German relations. His perspective provides a unique window into the British diplomatic approach at the time, especially as he was a senior figure actively trying to influence the course of events (✓\\checkmark✓VO). The purpose of the document—to recommend that the British press portray Hitler positively—reveals a strategic attempt to use media as a tool to steer Hitler toward peace, offering insight into the broader rationale behind appeasement policies (✓\\checkmark✓VP).

The purpose of advising the government to use the press to influence Hitler could be seen as overly optimistic, as it reflects Henderson's belief that media portrayal could sway Hitler's actions, which might not align with the reality of Hitler's ambitions (✓\\checkmark✓LP). Lastly, the content's suggestion to avoid criticizing Hitler directly could underestimate the true threat of Nazi Germany, as Henderson's approach may reflect wishful thinking about Hitler's potential for peace rather than a realistic assessment, thereby presenting a potentially misleading view of the risks of appeasement (✓\\checkmark✓LC).",

In addition, the origin of the source is limited as it was written in 1938 and so does not include the long term impact of the Abyssinian crisis on world peace (✓\\checkmark✓LO).",

The broad conclusions of this Note may be summarized as follows :-(a) A German absorption of Czechoslovakia will enhance her military prestige, increase her war potential and probably enable her to dispose of stronger land forces against France and ourselves than she can do at present.(b) So far as air power is concerned, Germany may be able to maintain her lead over the Franco-British Air Forces in air striking power.  On the other hand, it is open to us, provided that we make the necessary effort, to catch her up, or at least greatly reduce her lead, in the matter of defence (both active and passive) against air attack.  By so doing we shall have heavily insured ourselves against the greatest danger to which we are present exposed: indeed by substantially reducing Germany’s only chance of a rapid decision, we shall have provided a strong deterrent against her making the attempt.(c) It follows, therefore, that, from the military point of view, time is in our favour, and that, if war with Germany has to come, it would be better to fight her in say 6-12 months' time, than to accept the present challenge.[Source: Ismay, H.

The article seeks to justify Chamberlain's appeasement policy.As a central figure in British politics during a tumultuous decade—first as Chancellor of the British Exchequer from 1931-1937, then as Prime Minister—Chamberlain had to address a complex of problems that reached well beyond a revived Germany and a ranting dictator. Britain faced threats across the globe: Germany in Europe, Italy in the Mediterranean, and, perhaps most troubling of all, Japan in Asia and the Pacific. A war with any one of those three surely would lead the other two to horn in on British territories or possessions. Notions that Chamberlain did not comprehend the threat Germany posed or that appeasement constituted moral cowardice on his part or that Winston Churchill was the only figure on Britain’s political scene calling for rearmament and a hard line against Hitler—all standard to the anti-Chamberlain dossier—oversimplify history to the point of falsity.In the late 1930s, just about every important figure in British government, and/or at least the Conservative Party, knew that it was time to spend on national defense. In November 1933, 10 months after Hitler seized power, the British cabinet created a committee on defense requirements to study the cost of military modernization and how long the process would take. That planning culminated in early 1935 in a“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“White Paper.” The findings? Even if rearmament began immediately, Britain would not be ready to fight Germany until 1939. The analysis described weapons not yet in production, some of them only prototype sketches. The“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“Thirty-Niners,” as rearmament advocates were called, realized wishes took time to become reality, and that until then the thing to do was negotiate, buy time, and avoid a new war. And so, from 1935 on, Britain was in a juggling act: trying to appease Hitler, but also feverishly girding for an inevitable war. In that context, Chamberlain's much-maligned policy, distasteful as it appears, made some sense. Engaging Hitler in talks and turning a cheek to his invective gained Britain time to man up. Chamberlain probably did feel his actions might make war unnecessary, and even if he failed he could say—as he did on September 1, 1939—that he acted“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“with a clear conscience.”By then Britain was ready to fight—or at least far readier than a year before.“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“Last September we might have lost a short war,” Lieutenant General Henry Pownall, the army's chief planner, wrote at the time. “Now we shouldn't, nor a long one either.”[Source: Citino, R.

Source 2 mentions that Britain would benefit from a delay of 6-12 months to improve defenses against Germany's air power. Similarly, Source 3 emphasizes that Britain was targeting 1939 for readiness, as rearmament took years to reach effective levels..Each source acknowledges the military danger posed by Germany. Source 2 discusses Germany’s potential to enhance its power and threaten France and Britain directly, while Source 3 indicates that British leaders viewed Germany as part of a global threat matrix that required careful attention.Both sources suggest that rearmament was tied to appeasement. In Source 2, military buildup is linked to buying time against a possible German attack, while Source 3 indicates that appeasement was seen as a way to delay conflict until Britain was ready to confront Germany militarily.For contrast, any of the following differences:Source 2 views delaying a confrontation with Germany as a short-term tactic, suggesting a 6-12 month window for Britain to strengthen defenses. In contrast, Source 3 presents appeasement as a longer-term approach to buy time until full readiness by 1939, considering it necessary due to global commitments.Source 2 focuses narrowly on the immediate military threat posed by Germany and specifically discusses the impact of Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia on European security. Source 3, however, discusses Britain's broader geopolitical challenges, including threats from Italy and Japan, showing that British priorities extended beyond Europe.Source 2 does not mention Chamberlain directly, nor does it justify appeasement; it primarily discusses the military advantages of postponing conflict. In contrast, Source 3 explicitly defends Chamberlain's policy, arguing that his approach made sense given Britain's military limitations and that he was actively preparing Britain for a likely war.[6 marks maximum]Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:Both sources highlight that time was essential for Britain to build up its military strength before any possible conflict with Germany (✓\\checkmark✓similarity). In Source A, there's an emphasis on the benefit of even a short delay, suggesting that an additional 6-12 months would help Britain catch up in air defenses against Germany. Similarly, Source B reflects the need for time, indicating that Britain required several years of preparation to reach a state of readiness by 1939 (✓\\checkmark✓evidence) Additionally, both sources show a shared understanding that Germany posed a serious threat to Britain (✓\\checkmark✓similarity). Source A underscores the risk of Germany gaining a stronger military foothold in Europe, while Source B situates Germany as part of a broader set of threats facing Britain, reflecting a recognition of the country's growing danger (✓\\checkmark✓evidence).However, the sources differ in how they view the role of appeasement. Source 2 presents delay as a short-term, tactical response to give Britain some additional time, while Source 3 depicts appeasement as a longer-term strategy to strengthen British defenses over multiple years, aiming for sustained readiness by 1939 (✓\\checkmark✓difference✓\\checkmark✓evidence). Another difference lies in the scope of threats each source addresses. Source 2 is focused on Germany's actions in Europe, particularly in Czechoslovakia, as a primary concern. In contrast, Source 3 places Germany within a global context, showing that British officials were also concerned with threats from Italy and Japan, which required careful balancing of resources across multiple regions (✓\\checkmark✓difference✓\\checkmark✓evidence).",

This demonstrated the League’s inability to take meaningful action and paved the way for Italian and German expansion, ultimately leading to an alliance,Failure of diplomacy and appeasement:The policy of appeasement followed by Britain and France, two main members of the League who were pursuing self-interest , meant that they were largely unwilling to confront fascist aggression, shown, for example, by their lack of response to the invasion of the Rhineland, and the agreements made at the 1938 Munich Conference. This provided fascist leaders with confirmation that their expansionism would likely not be challenged.Failure of disarmament:League’s disarmament initiatives failed, such as at the 1932-33 Disarmament Conference.

A second failure of the League of Nations in the 1930s was its weak response to the Abyssinian Crisis. The sanctions that the LON imposed were ineffective because they left out essential resources like oil (✓\\checkmark✓).

      "markScheme": "Any combination offourof the following:Britain's acceptance of Hitler's initial foreign policies in 1934-1935 such as revising the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, a declaration of rearmament and implementing conscription gave Hitler the initial confidence that he would not be opposed.The signing the Anglo-German Naval pact of 1935 approving the expansion of the German Navy which would be limited to 35 percent of the size of the British navy; hence condoning the violation of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. This permitted German rearmament.Permitting Hitler's remilitarization of the Rhineland, another violation of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, strengthened Hiter's growing confidence that he would face no opposition from major European powers.Britain's acceptance of Anschluss, the annexation of Austria, in March of 1938 and which was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles, gave Hiter the confidence to expand into Czechoslovakia next.The signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938 permitted Hitler to occupy the Sudeten area of Czechoslovakia making it clear that he would be unopposed in his quest to expand Germany's existing borders.[4 marks maximum]Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:British policy of appeasement helped Hitler embark on his expansionist foreign policy. Lack of opposition to initial German rearmament and expansion of the German army permitted Hitler to strengthen his defence forces (✓\\checkmark✓). Germany rearmament was further validated with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval pact in 1935  that approved the expansion of the German Navy which would be limited to 35 percent of the size of the British navy. This British action condoned the violation of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and officially permitted German rearmament (✓\\checkmark✓). The lack of response from Britain (and France) when Hitler sent troops to take over Austria in March 1938, resulted in acceptance of Anschluss that was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. This gave Hiter the confidence to expand into Czechoslovakia next and increased his demands for Sudetenland, the German speaking area of Czechoslovakia (✓\\checkmark✓). The  highlight of the appeasement policy was the signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938, permitting Hiter to occupy the Sudeten area of Czechoslovakia. This further convinced Hitler that he would be unopposed in his quest to continually expand Germany's existing borders (✓\\checkmark✓).",

Then the British government entered on its policy of reprimanding Mussolini severely, but the words were not followed by acts.In summing up the Abyssinian story it must be stated that neither Britain nor France was ignorant of the ultimate aims of Mussolini; yet they not only did nothing to help Abyssinia, but rather prevented her from acquiring the necessary arms for defense, in the hope that Mussolini's friendship could thus be bought. He was assisted, also, by the long diplomatic conferences which he knew meant nothing. To be sure, at one time he feared that public opinion in England might demand the closing of the Suez Canal, but he need not have worried, since the British government had no intention of hindering him. The sanctions passed by the League were not carried out. Oil sanctions were solemnly discussed by various committees of nineteen and thirteen and committees of experts, but Mussolini threatened that if an oil embargo were declared he would fight. Just how he could have dared fight Britain and France and the other League members combined was never explained, but the bluff worked. No oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini. By use of gas and airplanes against a practically unarmed people Mussolini was able to subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence. The abortive sanctions and the reprimands of the British government and press were deeply resented by Mussolini who has never forgotten these“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“insults\" to Italian honor.On May 2, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie left Abyssinia and the Italians announced that they had obtained another great addition to their colonial empire. On May 9, from a balcony at the Palazzo Venezia, the Duce delivered a speech of defiance and proclaimed the king of Italy, emperor of Abyssinia.

On July 31, 1935, two months before Italian troops invaded Ethiopia, he wrote in the Popolo d'Italia that“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“the Italian-Ethiopian problem admitted of only one solution-with Geneva, without Geneva, against Geneva.\" On the very day that Italian soldiers crossed the Ethiopian frontiers, Baron Aloisi declared in Geneva that Italy acted in defense against Ethiopian aggression, and that Ethiopia was therefore guilty of a breach of the Covenant, and not Italy.When it seemed for a time that the League was serious about stopping Italy from continuing her war of conquest and began to impose sanctions against Italy, Mussolini wrote in the Popolo d'Italia of January 31, 1936, that“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“If the satanic oppression of the imperialists and of the bloodthirsty sects of Europe have their own way, Europe will inevitably fall into the most unjustified and terrible war that humanity has ever seen.\"In these words the fear of resolute League action was still discernible. The sanctions, however, proved ineffective because the League did not dare to impose the only sanction, the oil embargo, which would have brought the Fascist government to reason. Mussolini threatened that Italy would leave the League if it dared to execute faithfully the provisions of the Covenant, and the League backed down.
