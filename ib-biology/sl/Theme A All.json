      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:A DNA molecule is made up of two antiparallel strands of nucleotides. Antiparallel means that both strands are geometrically parallel but oriented in opposite directions (Option II). One of the strands is in the direction of 5' to 3', whereas the other strand is in the direction of 3' to 5'. The backbones, made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups, are held together by covalent sugar-phosphate bonds (Option III). Both of these strands are joined together by the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs.DNA strands are not identical (Option I) because identical would mean that they have the same nucleotide arrangement, instead they are complementary to each other.",

      "markScheme": "BExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Species that share a recent common ancestor, such as humans and chimpanzees, are more likely to have similar base sequences. Over time, as species diverge and evolve, mutations accumulate in their base sequences. The longer two species have been separated from their common ancestor, the more mutations will have accumulated in their genomes. Therefore, species that are closely related have fewer accumulated mutations and more similar base sequences (Choice B).Choice Ais incorrect because genome size is not necessarily proportional to the size of the species. The genome size can vary significantly even among organisms of similar size, and organisms with similar-sized genomes, such as the horse and mouse vary greatly in size.Choice Cis incorrect because it is possible to have a larger genome size with a comparable, or even smaller, number of genes, depending on the amount of non-coding DNA and repetitive sequences present in the genome. Humans have a larger genome but a similar number of genes to the chimpanzee, mouse and horse.Choice Dis incorrect because there is a difference of one nucleotide base in the table between humans and chimpanzees.

Explain why these birds are less likely to go extinct than the Moa.[1]Evidence suggests that the Tinamou and Moa shared a common ancestor, but they evolved independently from each other when they were geographically isolated millions of years ago. Explain the evolution of the Tinamou with reference to natural selection.[3]Another animal at risk of extinction is the Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), shown in the image below.

To determine evolutionary rates, both sequence similarity and known divergence times are needed.Choice Cis incorrect because the lowest sequence similarity (50%) between human and zebrafish suggests the longest time since divergence, not the most recent.Choice Dis incorrect because differences in sequence similarity alone cannot demonstrate variation in molecular clock rates. The molecular clock is a concept based on the idea that mutations accumulate at a relatively constant rate over time in most species.

      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Statement Iis true because cohesion refers to the attraction between water molecules due to hydrogen bonding. This cohesive property allows the water column to behave as a continuous stream, enabling tension created by transpiration at the leaves to be transmitted all the way down the xylem. This is central to the cohesion-tension theory of water transport.Statement IIis false because cohesion actually resists evaporation. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules make it harder for individual molecules to escape into the air. Evaporation is more closely influenced by temperature and humidity, not directly by cohesion.Statement IIIis true because adhesion is the attraction between water molecules and the walls of the xylem vessel. This helps to counteract gravity and supports the column, reducing the chance of it breaking, especially under tension during transpiration. So this contributes to the integrity of the water column.Choice Cis therefore the correct answer because it only includes the two trueStatements IandIII.Choice Ais incorrect as it is missing the trueStatement III.Choices BandDare incorrect as they include the falseStatement II.",

      "markScheme": "DExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Choice Dis correct because the transfer of ex-situ to in-situ means the return of species from captivity to areas that could become their natural habitats again. Nature reserves increase the chances of successful re-introduction, although many other measures would have to be taken to ensure success.Choice Ais incorrect because building more captive breeding areas will not increase the chances of being able to reintroduce species back into the wild.Choice Bis incorrect because, whilst artificial selection would allow desirable traits to be selected for in captivity, this would not necessarily guarantee that species would thrive or even survive in a wild habitat again. Artificial selection would also take a long time (measured in years and decades for some species in particular), as successive generations are bred.Choice Cis incorrect because having more animals in captivity and plants in botanical gardens would do little to increase the chances of those species being successfully reintroduced to the wild. A large captive population serves no natural purpose to conservation unless a species is released into the wild at some stage.

Because divergence doesn’t follow a fixed pattern, deciding when to define them as separate species becomes subjective.Statement IIis true because Populations might develop noticeable differences in traits (such as colouration or mating calls), but still produce fertile offspring when they interbreed. According to the biological species concept, they’re technically the same species, but these differences can confuse classification.Statement IIIis false because often, the opposite is true.

It focuses solely on species that are evolutionarily distinct and threatened with extinction.Choice Cis incorrect because while keystone species play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem structure and function, they are not necessarily evolutionarily distinct.

In fact, their function may differ considerably, for example, the forelimbs of bats for flight versus the flippers of dolphins for swimming. Homology is established based on shared structural origin, not shared function;Statement Iis false.Homologous structures are anatomical features found in different species that share a common evolutionary origin, even if they have diverged in form or function. Both bats and dolphins have a pentadactyl limb structure in their forelimbs, despite a differing external appearance and function. This reflects divergent evolution from a shared ancestor;Statement IIis true.Bat wings and insect wings are analogous structures. Although they perform a similar function (flight), they evolved independently in different evolutionary lineages and do not share embryological origin. Bat wings derive from the vertebrate limb, while insect wings arise from outgrowths of the arthropod exoskeleton.Statement IIIis false.Choice Bis the correct answer because it only includes the one trueStatement II.Choices A, CandDare incorrect as they include one or more of the falseStatements IandIII.",

In summer water absorbs heat energy and then in winter this heat energy is lost to the surrounding air helping to create milder microclimates. This enables the black-throated loon to inhabit areas where temperature might otherwise be too extreme.Choice Bis incorrect because it does not explain how winter air temperatures are made more moderate, only that ice insulates water that is below it which is not where the black-throated loon lives.Choice Cis incorrect because water does not have a low specific heat capacity.Choice Dis incorrect because, although it is a true statement, it does not explain how winter temperatures are made more moderate.",

At the melting point, the DNA double helix separates into two individual strands.Two DNA samples were compared, one consisting of only PQ pairs and another one consisting of only RS pairs.  Letters P, Q, R and S represent different nitrogenous bases found in the DNA.\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/d59dd324-98c9-4e4e-91b6-758d5679701c/images/0881eea3-e69e-45cc-ad3b-7c9e377763b5/BI0321.png)\n\n[ © Revision Village 2022]Based on the results presented in the graph, and your knowledge of nucleotide base pairing (between purines and pyrimidines), deduce which nitrogenous bases correspond to the letters P, Q, R and S.\\hspace{2.5em}P\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{2.5em}Q\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{2.5em}R\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{2.5em}S\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{1.5em}A.\\hspace{1.5em}CytosineGuanineThymineAdenine\\hspace{1.5em}B.\\hspace{1.5em}AdenineCytosineGuanineThymine\\hspace{1.5em}C.\\hspace{1.5em}GuanineAdenineThymineCytosine\\hspace{1.5em}D.\\hspace{1.5em}ThymineAdenineCytosineGuanine",
      "markScheme": "DExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Adenine pairs up with thymine and cytosine pairs up with guanine. Hence, PQ or RS would either be adenine with thymine or cytosine with guanine (Choices AandD), but definitely notChoices BorC.Cytosine and guanine pairing has three hydrogen bonds, whereas the adenine and thymine pairing has only two hydrogen bonds. At95oC95^oC95oC, there is a smaller percentage of RS-rich DNA melted content compared to PQ-rich DNA.This shows that RS would be cytosine and guanine pairing (Choice D) and PQ is adenine and thymine. Because the extra hydrogen bond between C and G makes it more temperature resistant compared to A and T.",
