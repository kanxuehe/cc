The genome size can vary significantly even among organisms of similar size, and organisms with similar-sized genomes, such as the horse and mouse vary greatly in size.Choice Cis incorrect because it is possible to have a larger genome size with a comparable, or even smaller, number of genes, depending on the amount of non-coding DNA and repetitive sequences present in the genome.

However, this has been disproven. State what evidence scientists may have found to disprove this relationship.[1]The Moa’s closest living relatives are the South American Tinamou (Tinamus major), which have the ability to fly. Explain why these birds are less likely to go extinct than the Moa.[1]Evidence suggests that the Tinamou and Moa shared a common ancestor, but they evolved independently from each other when they were geographically isolated millions of years ago. Explain the evolution of the Tinamou with reference to natural selection.[3]Another animal at risk of extinction is the Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), shown in the image below.

However, cladograms created by comparing such traits may be inaccurate because distantly related organisms can have structures that appear similar but have different genetic bases. The appearance of similar structures with a different evolutionary basis is not evidence of relatedness, but rather is evidence of convergent evolution. So, one reason the cladogram based on the DNA sequences is more reliable than the cladogram based on structures is that similar structures can be coded for by different genes in genetically distant organisms.Choice Ais incorrect because structures are inherited when species diverge, and the inheritance of structures is beneficial for constructing cladograms.  This is because shared structures are sometimes, but not always, evidence of genetic relatedness.Choice Bis incorrect because DNA does change over time.

      "markScheme": "DExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Thermal conductivity refers to a material's ability to conduct heat. While water does have a relatively high thermal conductivity compared to other liquids, this property is not directly related to the ability of the water strider to stay on the surface of the water. The image does not depict thermal conductivity, soChoice Dis correct.Choice Ais incorrect as adhesion is the ability of water to form hydrogen bonds with other polar molecules. The ability of the water strider to stay on the surface of the water is due to surface tension and adhesion between the water molecules and its legs.Choice Bis incorrect as the water strider can stay on the water surface due to the exertion of buoyant forces, which counteract its weight.Choice Cis incorrect as cohesion is the ability of water molecules to stick to each other, which creates the surface tension that allows the water strider to rest on top of the water.",

Modern cells are descendants but not the original first cells;Choice Bis incorrect.\nThere is very limited or no direct fossil evidence of the first protocells because they were microscopic, soft-bodied, and lacked durable structures that fossilise well. The lack, rather than the abundance, of fossil evidence is a key challenge to testing the hypothesis about the origin of the first cells;Choice Cis incorrect.\nCurrent scientific understanding strongly supports that protocells contained early forms of genetic material, such as RNA molecules. RNA is believed to have played a dual role as both a genetic material and a catalyst (ribozymes), making it central to hypotheses like the RNA world hypothesis.\nNucleic acids are crucial because they enable self-replication and heredity, essential for the evolution of life.Choice Dcontradicts the accepted hypotheses and is therefore incorrect.",

      "markScheme": "AExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Choice Ais correct because there is a higher percentage similarity for the cytochrome c amino acid sequence between the human and chimpanzee (99%) compared to the human and mouse (87%). This indicates less time for mutations to accumulate, meaning humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor more recently than humans and mice.Choice Bis incorrect because although the cytochrome c percentage similarity is lower in chickens (75%) than in mice (87%), this alone does not confirm that cytochrome c evolved faster in the chicken lineage. To determine evolutionary rates, both sequence similarity and known divergence times are needed.Choice Cis incorrect because the lowest sequence similarity (50%) between human and zebrafish suggests the longest time since divergence, not the most recent.Choice Dis incorrect because differences in sequence similarity alone cannot demonstrate variation in molecular clock rates. The molecular clock is a concept based on the idea that mutations accumulate at a relatively constant rate over time in most species. To conclude rate differences, both the time since divergence and the number of accrued changes must both be known.",

      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Statement Iis true because cohesion refers to the attraction between water molecules due to hydrogen bonding. This cohesive property allows the water column to behave as a continuous stream, enabling tension created by transpiration at the leaves to be transmitted all the way down the xylem. This is central to the cohesion-tension theory of water transport.Statement IIis false because cohesion actually resists evaporation. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules make it harder for individual molecules to escape into the air. Evaporation is more closely influenced by temperature and humidity, not directly by cohesion.Statement IIIis true because adhesion is the attraction between water molecules and the walls of the xylem vessel. This helps to counteract gravity and supports the column, reducing the chance of it breaking, especially under tension during transpiration. So this contributes to the integrity of the water column.Choice Cis therefore the correct answer because it only includes the two trueStatements IandIII.Choice Ais incorrect as it is missing the trueStatement III.Choices BandDare incorrect as they include the falseStatement II.",

Artificial selection would also take a long time (measured in years and decades for some species in particular), as successive generations are bred.Choice Cis incorrect because having more animals in captivity and plants in botanical gardens would do little to increase the chances of those species being successfully reintroduced to the wild.

The plant is animal-pollinated (the flower has large petals and internal reproductive structures (stigma and anthers), indicating animal pollination). It also has more than 10 stamens and an ovary that is taller than it is wide. This takes us to step 4. From the diagram on the right, we can see that the flower has fewer sepals than petals which means it must be plant T.Choice Ais incorrect because the flower in the diagram is animal-pollinated as it has anthers and a stigma held inside the large, colourful petals.Step 2: The image only shows half the flower, which has 11 stamens visible. This means the full flower has more than eleven stamens;Choice Bis, therefore, incorrect.Choice Dis incorrect because, in step 3, the ovary is taller than it is wide, so it can't be flowerR.",

      "markScheme": "AExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Statement Iis true because, during speciation, some traits (e.g., behaviour, physiology, morphology) can evolve faster than others. This means two populations might look different but still interbreed, or might appear similar but already be reproductively isolated. Because divergence doesn’t follow a fixed pattern, deciding when to define them as separate species becomes subjective.Statement IIis true because Populations might develop noticeable differences in traits (such as colouration or mating calls), but still produce fertile offspring when they interbreed. According to the biological species concept, they’re technically the same species, but these differences can confuse classification.Statement IIIis false because often, the opposite is true. Genetic differences (mutations, allele frequency changes) may accumulate before any visible morphological change occurs. For example, two populations may look identical but carry distinct genetic markers and be reproductively isolated.Saying morphological change “always” comes first is incorrect and overly simplistic.Choice Ais correct because it includes only the two trueStatements IandII.Choices B, CandDare incorrect as they include the falseStatement III.",

Hydrated minerals contain water in their crystal structures. Hydrated minerals originating from meteorites can become dehydrated through heating, releasing water vapour into the surroundings and leaving behind anhydrous minerals;Choice Dis correct.Water molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen atoms, each of which can exist as different isotopes. In planetary science, scientists compare the ratios of these isotopes (such as the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio or theX18X2218O/X16X2216O\\ce{^{18}O/^{16}O}X18​X2218​O/X16​X2216​Oratio) to trace the origin of water.Choice Ais incorrect because it implies that meteorites contain ice with exactly the same isotopes as those in Earth’s oceans. In reality, all water contains the same possible isotopes, but the key evidence lies in the relative proportions of these isotopes. Some meteorites contain water with a similar isotopic ratio to Earth's oceans, not an identical isotopic composition. Therefore, the claim is misleading.Cohesion is a process that does not require anything but water molecules, it is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Some evidence of amino acids has been found in meteorites, but no evidence of polypeptides.Choice Bis incorrect.Meteorites travel through the vacuum of space, where temperatures are far too low to sustain liquid water. Also, no compelling evidence exists that meteorite-bound water has similar salinity to Earth's oceans.;Choice Cis incorrect.",

Fluorescent dyes or antibodies emit specific wavelengths of light, highlighting target molecules, but they do not provide detailed structural information about proteins.Choice Dis incorrect because immunofluorescence identifies specific proteins in cells or tissues using fluorescently tagged antibodies.

This DNA copy is then integrated into the host cell’s genome, allowing the virus to hijack the host's transcription and translation machinery to produce viral proteins and replicate itself.Choice Ais incorrect because a DNA-containing virus would simply use the host cell’s replication mechanisms to replicate its DNA; there would be no need for reverse transcription.Choice Cis incorrect because reverse transcription involves the conversion of RNA into DNA.Choice Dis incorrect because, whilst the viral DNA copy does get incorporated into the host cell’s genome, this cannot be regarded as host cell DNA as it remains distinct from the host's original DNA. It is not accurate to refer to this DNA as \"host cell DNA\" since it originates from the virus.",

The definition given in the table describes diploidy (2n), which is the standard chromosome number in most sexually reproducing organisms;Choice Aincorrect.Interbreeding between different species can sometimes produce infertile offspring, such as a horse × donkey = mule. This is an example of reproductive isolation because the hybrid offspring is sterile, preventing gene flow between the two species. However, because horses and donkeys are already separate species, this does not result in speciation—it simply reinforces their reproductive barrier.

Its sequence differs enough between species to allow clear differentiation, yet it remains consistent within individuals of the same species.

The cytochrome oxidase I gene is not exclusive to animals; it is found in the mitochondria of many eukaryotes. Its utility for animal barcoding comes from its pattern of variability, not its exclusivity.Choice Dis incorrect. The cytochrome oxidase I gene is mitochondrial, not nuclear, and its evolutionary rate is moderate rather than extremely rapid.

The nearly identical genetic code across all known forms of life. implies that the code was established very early in the history of life and has been conserved through billions of years of evolution. If different forms of life had arisen independently, it is highly unlikely that they would all use the same genetic code.The machinery for protein synthesis,(Statement II)which includes ribosomes, transfer RNA (tRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA), is remarkably conserved across all forms of cellular life. This high degree of similarity suggests that these complex molecular mechanisms were inherited from a common ancestor, known as the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).ATP as a common energy currency(Statement III)used by organisms as diverse as bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes suggests that this energy system was established early in the evolutionary history of life and inherited from a single ancestral organism. If different forms of life had evolved independently, it is unlikely that they would all rely on the same molecule for energy, reinforcing the idea of a shared origin.",

Also, biological polymers did not exist until after life emerged.Choice Bis incorrect.If water had entered the mantle, the heat there would cause it to evaporate instantly, and therefore, water would not be retained on Earth.

This is, therefore, an example of polyploidy and sympatric speciation.Choice Ais incorrect because, although bonobos and chimpanzees were geographically isolated from each other (allopatric speciation), there was no increase in the chromosome number during the speciation event.Choice Cis incorrect because the lava fields geographically isolated the tortoises, leading to sub-species forming. This is, therefore, an ongoing allopatric speciation event, not sympatric, and it does not involve polyploidy.

      "markScheme": "BExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Choice Bis correct because both Lamarckism and epigenetic inheritance propose that environmental factors can cause inherited changes, while Lamarckism suggested these changes were permanent and led to evolution through traits acquired during an organism's lifetime. Epigenetic changes involve reversible chemical modifications to DNA or histone proteins that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. These epigenetic changes can be passed to offspring, but often only persist for a few generations and typically do not lead to long-term evolutionary change.Choice Ais incorrect because neither Lamarckism nor epigenetic inheritance involves changes to the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetics modifies gene expression through chemical tags, while Lamarckism assumed physical or behavioural changes were inherited.Choice Cis incorrect because only Lamarckism proposed that the use or disuse of traits directly causes evolutionary change. Epigenetic inheritance does not involve the use or disuse of structures but rather chemical changes to gene regulation influenced by environmental factors. Furthermore, epigenetics does not lead to evolution.Choice Dis incorrect because epigenetic inheritance does not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself and therefore does not cause long-term evolutionary change.",

In the mRNA, these bases will be matched with their complementary base pair, so that the percentage value in the cytosine row will be the same as the percentage of guanine, so X = 25.2%. Likewise, Y will be the cytosine percentage (21.4%). Z is 0%, as there are no thymine bases found in mRNA, only uracil.Choice Ais not correct because even though X and Y are showing the right percentages, Z is incorrect as it is showing the percentage of uracil, not thymine.Choice Bis not correct because the percentages shown are for the DNA not for the complementary base pair of that base (which would be found in the mRNA), Z is also incorrect as it is showing the percentage of uracil, not thymine.Choice Dis not correct because the percentages shown are for the DNA not for the complementary base pair of that base (which would be found in the mRNA).",

When anodd number of chromosomesis present (✓\\checkmark✓) in the daughter species, for example, 3n,meiosis is impossible(✓\\checkmark✓), and the daughter species can only reproduce asexually through mitosis.
