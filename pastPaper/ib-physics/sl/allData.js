Due to air resistance, It experiences negative acceleration (opposite to the direction of motion). The force from air resistance is proportional to the speed of the object. Since a decrease in speed results in a decrease in air resistance, the magnitude of negative acceleration should decrease over time. The gradient of the $v-t$ graphs indicates acceleration. The only graph that has a decreasing negative gradient is B.\nTherefore, the answer is B.',

Although gravitational attraction is constant, air resistance decreases with speed. Therefore, the total force opposing the motion decreases. This results in a decrease in deceleration.\nWhen the acceleration decreases, the change in velocity gets lower for a constant change in time. Thus the gradient should decrease.

      'A\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\nA released marble can cover the same distance in a shorter time when it has greater acceleration. To get greater acceleration, the resultant force downward should be bigger. Three forces are acting on the ball the weight of the ball, buoyancy, and drag. While buoyancy and drag are upwards, weight is downwards. Note that because the marbles are stated to have equal masses, the downwards force of gravity on both marbles is the same.\nThe buoyant force:\n\n\n- $F_b = V\\rho g$\n\nWeight:\n\n\n- $W=mg$\n\nDrag:\n\n\n- $F_d = 6\\pi \\eta rv$\n\nThe resultant force $F_{net}$:\n\n\n- $F_{net}=mg-(V\\rho g+6\\pi \\eta rv)$\n\nBased on the equation above, when the drag force or buoyancy is reduced, the resultant force becomes greater. As the density of the liquid decreases, the magnitude of the buoyant force decreases.\nMoreover, a decrease in diameter directly leads to a decrease in drag force and buoyancy.\nAlternatively, if we consider the terminal velocity, this results when the net force is zero.\nTherefore\n\n\n- $F_g = F_d+F_b$\n- $mg = \\rho V g+6\\pi \\eta rv$\n\nSolving for terminal velocity gives\n\n\n- $v = \\dfrac{mg-\\rho V g}{6\\pi \\eta r}$\n\nSubstituting the fomula for the volume of a sphere\n\n\n- $v = \\dfrac{mg-\\rho (\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3) g}{6\\pi \\eta r}$\n\nWe see that as $r$ increases, the numerator will at some point reach zero. This will be the point at which the density of the marble equals the density of the fluid. We are told that the marble always sinks, and so the numerator must remain positive.\nLooking at the expression, decreasing $r$ will have the effect of both increasing the numerator (thus increasing the velocity) and decreasing the denominator (also increasing the velocity).',

    markScheme:
      'C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\nA. Incorrect. Because $E_k$ changed from zero to non-zero because the chemical potential energy in the firecracker is converted into kinetic energy which is divided between the two parts after the explosion.\nB. Incorrect. Because $E_k=\\left(\\dfrac{p^2}{2m}\\right)$ and the momenta must be equal, the kinetic energies must be unequal as the masses are not equal.\nC. Correct. Momentum is always conserved in any process for an isolated system.\nD. Incorrect. Because since momentum is conserved, unequal parts must have unequal velocities.',

Due to the absence of a vertical force, there will be no change in the vertical component of the momentum of the ball, and all of the momentum change is in the horizontal direction.\nBecause the collision is elastic, the speed of the ball is unchanged in the collision. As the vertical component of the velocity is unchanged, it follows that the magnitude of the horizontal component of the velocity is also unchanged.\nGiven that the magnitudes of the components are both unchanged, the angles $\\theta_1\\ $and $\\theta_2$ must be equal.\nIt has been determined that the only change in momentum is in the horizontal direction.\nTherefore,\n\n\n- $∆p_h=p_{fh}-p_{ih}$\n- $p_{ih}=mv\\,(\\sin\\,\\theta_1)$\n\nand\n\n\n- $p_{fh}=-mv(\\sin\\,\\theta_2)$\n- $\\Delta p_h=p_{fh}-p_{ih}=-mv\\sin\\,θ_2-mv\\sin\\,θ_1$\n\nBut\n\n\n- $\\theta_1=\\theta_2$\n\nTherefore\n\n\n- $\\Delta p_h=-2mv(\\sin\\,θ_1)$\n\nThus\n\n\n- $\\Delta p=-2mv(\\sin\\,θ_1)$\n',

Therefore, it is in the same direction as the force of dynamic friction and tension. Instead of the force of dynamic friction with tension only, the resultant force of air friction, tension and the force of dynamic friction balances the component of weight. Hence, the force of dynamic friction would be lower. This would lead to a lower calculated value for coefficient of friction.\n\n",

The vertical forces on each block cancel each other. Therefore, only horizontal forces create acceleration. The only horizontal force acting on the block with a mass of 5.0 kg is the force due to static friction between the blocks. The acceleration of 5.0 kg mass can be found by Newton's second law ($F_{net}=ma$):\n    ![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/d3918ccc-5576-4eff-a23b-7749484ed10c/images/3af533e6-d79a-41ea-8adb-f805fc93cde4/Screenshot%202025-05-28%20at%201.16.32%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n\n\n    The acceleration of 5.0 kg mass can be found by Newton's second law ($F_{net}=ma$):\n    \n    \n    - $F_f = 5a \\hspace{2em}$ (first expression)\n\n    Two horizontal forces are acting on the 2.0 kg mass as $F$ and the force of static friction.\n    ![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/d3918ccc-5576-4eff-a23b-7749484ed10c/images/4c19e1d9-65aa-4a50-a913-d1ad7c2cc1f6/Screenshot%202025-05-28%20at%201.16.22%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n\n\n    The acceleration of 2.0 kg mass can be found by:\n    \n    \n    - $F - F_f = 2.0a \\hspace{2em}$ (second expression)\n\n    Since maximum $F$ is investigated, the maximum value of $F_f$ should be employed.\n    \n    \n    - $F_{fmax}=\\mu_s R \\hspace{1em}$    where $\\mu_s=0.5$ and $R=mg=(2.0)(9.81)=20$ N\n    - $F_{fmax} = (0.50)(20) = 9.8$ N\n\n    This is the net force acting on the bottom block.
