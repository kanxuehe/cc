This question considers the validity of the company's claims regarding the weights of their products.\nLime mortar is a mixture used in construction to reduce moisture in masonry. The mixture contains cement, lime and sand in the ratio $a:b:c$, where $a+b+c=17$.\nCement costs $$0.50$ per kilogram, lime costs $$2.75$ per kilogram and sand costs $$0.06$ per kilogram.\nFrank and Kevin have separately purchased $5a$ kilograms of cement, $5b$ kilograms of lime and $5c$ kilograms of sand each for their respective construction projects, in the correct ratio. They have made their purchases at different shops and therefore they have been charged different prices.\nThe following table shows how much Frank and Kevin were charged per kilogram for each product, and the total amount they had to pay.\n\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/a98d123f-26a9-4287-a7fa-a3cc772e4d50/images/cd897c39-7e85-46b7-aed8-ada41f27dcdc/1169a.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine a matrix equation of the form $Ax=b$ to represent the information given above.[2]\n\n\n\nHence, find the values of $a,b$ and $c$.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cement is sold in $10$kg bags. The manufacturer claims that the weights of the bags, $C$, are such that $C∼N(10.2,0.12)$.\n\nCalculate the probability that a randomly selected bag weighs less than $10$kg. Give your answer to four significant figures.[2]\n\n\nBena needs a total of 200 kilograms and is given two options by the manufacturer.\nOption one: Twenty of the $10$kg bags so that $T1​=C1​+C2​+⋯+C20​$\nOption two: A single $200$kg “mega-bag” such that $T2​=20C$.\n\n\nDetermine\n\n\nThe distribution of $T1​$ .[3]\n\n\n\n$P(T1​>200)$[1]\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine\n\n\nThe distribution of $T2​$ .[3]\n\n\n\n$P(T2​>200)$[1]\n\n\n\n\n\nState which option Bena should choose, giving a reason.[1]\n\n\n\nBena chooses option one. She suspects that the manufacturer’s claim is incorrect. To test this hypothesis, she weighs all twenty bags. If more than two bags weigh less than $10$kg, she will reject the manufacturer’s claim.\n\nCalculate the significance level of Bena’s hypothesis test.[3]\n\n\nBena finds that nine of her bags weigh less than $10$kg and lays a complaint with the manufacturer. The manufacturer concedes that they made an error, and while the mean weight of their bags is $10.2$ kg, in their claim they had accidentally written the variance as $0.12$, when it was in fact $0.1$.\n\n\nGiven this new information, find the probability that Bena could have made a type II error in her hypothesis test.[3]\n\n\n\nIf Bena had conducted her original hypothesis test with the correct information from the manufacturer, at the significance level found in part (f), determine the critical region for the test.[3]\n\n\n\nHence state whether she would have rejected the manufacturer’s claim.
