        "content": "Shoon is a publicly-held, fast fashion retailer, operating in numerous countries across the world. Its primary manufacturing facility is located in Bangladesh, where it produces large volumes of affordable, fashionable clothing for global markets. The company’s manufacturing operations in Bangladesh have created thousands of jobs for local people, providing much-needed employment opportunities in a country where work is often hard to find.However, Shoon has faced growing criticism over the working conditions within its factories. Reports suggest that many employees work long hours for very low pay, raising concerns about exploitation and the ethical standards of the business. Recently, rumours have surfaced that Shoon may soon relocate its manufacturing operations to a different country. This speculation comes in response to an anticipated increase in the minimum wage by the Bangladeshi government, which could make it more expensive for Shoon to continue its operations there.In addition to labour concerns, Shoon’s denim manufacturing process has drawn criticism for its labour-intensive nature and high water usage. Local farmers have complained that the factory’s water consumption is contributing to droughts in surrounding agricultural areas, placing further strain on the environment and local communities who rely on water for their crops and livelihoods.Definethe term multinational company.[2]Statetwo features of a publicly held company.[2]Explainone benefit and two drawbacks for Bangladesh of hosting the multinational company (MNC) Shoon.[6][Maximum 10]",

Shoon provides thousands of jobs to local workers in its factories, which helps reduce unemployment and offers a source of income in a country where jobs can be difficult to find. This employment can contribute to economic growth and help improve living standards for some individuals and their families.A significant drawback is the risk of worker exploitation. As seen in Shoon's case, workers may face long hours and very low pay, which raises ethical concerns and highlights how multinationals might prioritise low costs over employee welfare. This can lead to dissatisfaction and social tensions within the local population.Another drawback is the environmental damage caused by some multinational operations. Shoon’s labour-intensive and water-heavy manufacturing processes have led to complaints from local farmers about droughts, suggesting that such companies can contribute to environmental degradation, harming agriculture and local livelihoods.Mark allocation:Mark as 2 + [2 + 2]Award[1]for identifying one benefit for a Bangladesh for hosting Shoon and an additional[1]for explaining it up to a maximum of[2].For each benefit mark as2 + 2.Award[1]for identifying a drawback for Bangladesh for hosting Shoon  and an additional[1]for explaining it up to a maximum of[2].Award a maximum of[6].",

Younger members may want to invest in new technology, but older members are resistant to change, which could create tension and delay important decisions for the cooperative’s future.Another challenge is competition from larger agricultural companies that benefit from economies of scale. Since FairHarvest is a smaller cooperative, they may struggle to match the prices and production output of larger, non-organic farming companies.

        "content": "Leafy Bites is a small, family-run business that specialises in selling freshly prepared vegetarian and vegan lunches. Operating from a single location in a small town, the owners have intentionally kept the business small allowing them to maintain close relationships with their loyal customers and to focus on quality over rapid expansion.While Leafy Bites has a strong reputation locally, it has considered internal growth strategies such as expanding the menu and extending opening hours to attract more customers. However, these changes have placed extra pressure on the small team, leading to longer working hours and operational inefficiencies.The owners have been approached by potential investors interested in turning Leafy Bites into a franchise to expand into larger cities. While the owners see franchising as an opportunity to grow the brand, they are concerned about losing control over quality and customer service, which are central to their current success.Statetwo reasons why businesses choose to remain small.[2]In the context of Leafy Bites,explaintwo disadvantages of internal growth.[4]In the context of Leafy Bites,outlineone advantage and one disadvantage of franchising.[4][Maximum 10]",

No explanation required.Sample response:Businesses relying solely on internal expansion may struggle to grow quickly enough to compete with faster-moving rivals. Leafy Bites is trying to grow by expanding its menu and increasing opening hours, but this method is slow and puts pressure on its small team, limiting how quickly the business can capture more customers or revenue.Internal growth often places strain on a firm’s existing resources, such as staff, equipment, and management time, without bringing in the immediate support that external growth could provide. By trying to grow internally, Leafy Bites has increased workloads for its small team, leading to longer working hours and inefficiencies. This strain affects the business’s ability to maintain quality and operate effectively.Mark allocation:Mark as 2 + 2Award[1]for a relevant disadvantage with an additional[1]. for application to the case study.Award a maximum of[4].Sample response:Franchising allows a business to expand rapidly into new markets without having to invest large amounts of its own capital. The franchisees cover the costs of setting up and running their own outlets, making growth less risky and less expensive for the franchisor.\nFor Leafy Bites, franchising would allow the brand to expand into larger cities more quickly without the owners needing to invest heavily in new locations. This could help the business grow its market presence and reputation beyond its small town.One disadvantage of franchising is that the franchisor loses some control over how franchisees run their outlets. This can lead to inconsistencies in product quality, customer service, and brand reputation if franchisees do not follow the original business standards.\nThe owners of Leafy Bites are concerned that by franchising, they may lose control over the high quality and personalised customer service that has been key to their success. Poor management by franchisees could harm the business’s reputation.Mark allocation:Mark as 2 + 2Award[1]for a relevant advantage with an additional[1]for application to the case study.Award[1]for a relevant disadvantage with an additional[1]for application to the case study.Award a maximum of[4].",

Initially, Ben operates as a sole trader and hires two part-time baristas. He plans to expand Ben’s Fika into a small chain within the next five years.Ben faces challenges such as competition from large coffee chains, high rental costs in Stockholm, and the need to build brand loyalty from scratch.

The owner, Jawaher, is personally involved in every aspect of the business and had daily contact with customers, offering a warm, personalized experience. She was known for being quick to respond to customer feedback, often incorporating popular requests into the development of new soap varieties. This responsiveness helped PureBliss build a loyal local customer base.As PureBliss continues to grow in popularity, Jawaher is finding it increasingly difficult to manage the workload on her own. With rising demand and plans to expand the product range, she recognises the need for additional capital to support the next phase of growth. However, Jawaher is highly protective of the creative process and wants to ensure the brand’s unique identity remains intact.For this reason, she is considering taking on a silent partner. Jawaher has done her research on types of legal business structures, and believes this is the most suitable for her to grow her business.Definethe term silent partner.[2]Explaintwo advantages for Jawaher of setting up PureBliss as a sole trader.[4]Explaintwo disadvantages for Jawaher of taking on a silent partner.[4][Maximum 10]",
        "markScheme": "Sample response:A silent (or sleeping) partner is an individual who contributes capital to a business but does not participate in its daily management or operations.

She could decide on product designs, pricing, suppliers, and marketing without needing approval from partners or shareholders. This allowed her to quickly respond to customer feedback and introduce new soap varieties based on popular demand, helping the business grow and build customer loyalty.Another major advantage is that Jawaher was entitled to keep all the profits the business made.

While this means Jawaher retains creative control, it also means she would still be responsible for managing the growing workload on her own. If Jawaher's aim is to grow the business, this is likely to lead to increased stress and operational challenges.A second drawback is that Jawaher would have to share the business profits with the sleeping partner. Even though the partner is not involved in managing the business, they are still entitled to a portion of the earnings, which reduces Jawaher’s overall financial return from the success she built.Mark allocation:Mark as 2 + 2Award[1]for each drawback identified and an additional[1]for application to the case study.Award a maximum of[4].",

The company was founded with an environmentally-focused mission, committed to using sustainable materials and reducing carbon emissions. Initially, GreenTech raised capital through private investment and grants to support its operations.However, as the company expanded and sought additional funding to scale operations, GreenTech Innovations transitioned into a Publicly Held Company (PLC). The decision to become a  PLC was driven by the need to raise significant capital for research and development, and to expand production capacity.Since becoming a PLC, GreenTech Innovations has faced increasing pressure from investors to improve profitability and deliver short-term returns. Investors are demanding higher profits and faster growth, which has led to a shift in strategy.

Becoming a PLC allowed GreenTech Innovations to raise a significant amount of capital which  enabled the company to invest in new technologies and expand production capacity, helping it grow more quickly than it could as a limited company.One disadvantage for a business when it changes from being a privately held business to a PLC is that there can be greater pressure from shareholders for short-term profits, potentially conflicting with a company’s original mission. Since becoming a PLC, GreenTech Innovations faces intense pressure from shareholders to deliver higher profits and short-term growth. This has created tension with the company’s original mission of promoting renewable energy, as some investors are pushing for diversification into oil and gas — industries that directly contradict its environmentally focused goals. As a result, the company risks drifting away from its founding values, damaging its green reputation, and alienating environmentally conscious customers, all in an effort to satisfy the demands of profit-driven shareholders.Mark allocation:Award[1]for an advantage/disadvantage identified, and and additional[1]for application to the case study.Award a maximum of[4].",

The ownership is dispersed among numerous shareholders.Aprivately held companyis owned by shareholders with limited liability, but its shares cannot be bought or sold by the general public on the stock exchange. The ownership is confined to a smaller number of founders and investors. Shareholders can buy or sell shares only with the board of directors' approval.Publicly held companiescan raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) when a publicly held company first sells all or part of its shares to external investors. The company can sell shares to the public and generate finance for expansion or acquisitions.Privately held companieshave more limited options for raising capital. Their usual sources are loans from banks or financial institutions, private investments or retained earnings.Publicly held companiesare subject to stringent regulatory requirements imposed by government authorities, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) in Europe. Regulators strictly enforce compliance with corporate governing standards, accurate financial reporting and disclosure obligations.Privately held companiesface relatively fewer regulatory obligations. Their financial disclosures need not be as detailed as those of a publicly held company, and they have more flexibility in their corporate governance.A characteristic ofpublicly held companiesis a separation between the numerous owners and those who manage and run the company. Shareholders have voting rights, often in proportion to the size of their shareholding. The functionaries are elected and appointed through voting. In reality, shareholders have limited influence over operations.Privately held companieshave a more direct link between shareholders and control of the company. The owners are often directly involved in the management or have control over strategic decisions and governance.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each difference.2 marksfor explaining each difference.Total- 4 marks",

On the other hand, suppliers aim to maintain their revenue and profit margins.Payment Terms: Shareholders may prefer longer payment terms to improve the company's cash flow and bottom line, as this delays the outflow of funds. However, suppliers generally prefer shorter payment terms, as it helps them maintain a consistent cash flow.Quality vs Cost: Shareholders may focus on cost control and profitability, often pushing for lower-priced materials or services. Suppliers, on the other hand, may emphasise the importance of maintaining the quality of goods or services provided.Supply Chain Reliability: Shareholders may seek to diversify the supply chain to mitigate risk, potentially by engaging multiple suppliers. Suppliers, however, prefer exclusivity and consistent orders.Contract Negotiations: Shareholders may expect aggressive contract negotiations with suppliers to secure favourable terms for the company. Suppliers may view these negotiations as overly demanding or unfair, potentially harming their relationship with the company and affecting future cooperation.Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals: Shareholders often have a vested interest in the company's stock performance in the short term. This may lead to a focus on immediate cost reduction, which can conflict with a supplier's perspective that prioritises building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships.Sample response‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}Sample response​:Shareholders often seek to maximise profits and returns on their investments in the company. This objective may lead them to desire cost-cutting measures, which could include pressuring the management to negotiate lower prices with suppliers. On the other hand, suppliers aim to maintain their revenue and profit margins. Thus, when shareholders push for reduced costs, it can put suppliers in a difficult position, as they may need to make concessions that impact their own profitability.Shareholders like longer payment terms when the company owes money because this means the company can hold onto its cash for a longer period. Holding onto cash can improve the company's financial position and give it more flexibility. When the company has more cash on hand, it appears healthier and more stable.On the other hand, suppliers prefer shorter payment terms when they sell something. They want to get paid quickly because it ensures they have a steady inflow of cash. This consistent cash inflow is crucial for them to manage their own expenses and keep their operations running smoothly.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each reason.2 marksfor explaining each reason.Total- 4 marks",

For instance, acquiring a company immediately increases the acquiring company's size, market share, and resources. This rapid expansion is particularly advantageous in fast-moving industries or when a company must adjust quickly to market changes. It's also a quick way to access new technologies, products, or markets without the time and resources needed to develop them internally.Economies of scalerefer to the cost advantages a business obtains due to expansion. As the scale of operation increases, the cost per production unit typically decreases. Here's how external growth can enhance economies of scale:Increased Production: By acquiring or merging with another company, a business can increase its production capacity, leading to lower costs per unit due to the spread of fixed costs over a larger output.Purchasing Power: Larger organisations often have greater bargaining power with suppliers, which can lead to reduced costs for raw materials and other inputs.Market Access: Expanding into new markets (geographical or product markets) can increase the customer base, spreading the fixed costs of operations over a more extensive revenue base, thus reducing the average cost.This can result in more competitive pricing, higher margins, or both, which are crucial for long-term business sustainability and market competitiveness.Disadvantages:Higher cost: External growth costs more than internal growth.Greater risk: The uncertainties of external growth translate to more significant risks.Culture clash: Combining two organisations can result in a culture clash.Sample response:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}Sample response:​Higher cost: External growth comes with a high price tag. Acquisition of another organisation requires interest-bearing finance. The price for the acquisition might be high, with shareholders taking advantage and demanding a higher-than-fair price.Greater risk: External growth, such as mergers and acquisitions, carries greater risk due to the complexities of integrating different organisational cultures, systems, and processes. This can lead to operational disruptions and employee dissatisfaction. Additionally, the significant financial investment required for external growth poses a risk if the anticipated benefits and synergies still need to be fully realised. These challenges, coupled with potential regulatory hurdles and stakeholder resistance, make external growth a riskier strategy than internal growth's more controlled and incremental approach.Culture clash: Two organisations coming together during the process of external growth can experience a cultural clash due to the difference in governance and management styles. While this can be eventually resolved, the resulting conflict can result from inefficient operations and decisions, causing tangible financial losses and a dissatisfied customer base.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each advantage and disadvantage.2 marksfor explaining each advantage and disadvantage..Total- 4 marks",

Aims, the broader and more abstract of the two, serve as the overarching vision and long-term goals of the organisation. They provide a sense of direction and purpose, helping to align the efforts of the business towards a common goal. However, it's essential to recognise that aims lack specificity and measurability. These goals are often open-ended, lacking specific details or deadlines. For instance, an aim for a business might be the ambition to“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“become a market leader in the industry.”\\text{\\textquotedblright}”While this is undoubtedly a big aspiration that provides a sense of direction, it does not contain the specific criteria necessary for measurement, nor does it stipulate a deadline for its achievement.In contrast, objectives are the practical, specific, and measurable steps that a business puts in place to realise its aims. Objectives are designed to be actionable and serve as the bridge between the broad aspirations encapsulated in aims and the practical implementation required for success. These objectives are characterised by their high level of specificity and measurability. For example, if the aim is to become a market leader, objectives may include“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“increase market share by 10% within the next two years”\\text{\\textquotedblright}”or“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“launch a new product line by the end of the fiscal year.”\\text{\\textquotedblright}”Objectives are often set with clear criteria, such as deadlines, quantities, or percentages, making it possible to track progress and determine success.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each difference.2 marksfor explaining each difference.Total- 4 marks",

        "markScheme": "Internal growth, also known as organic growth, refers to the expansion of a business through the use of its own resources and capabilities. This growth is typically achieved through increasing output, enhancing sales, or improving the business's products or services, often by reinvesting profits back into the business. It is characterized by a gradual and steady growth trajectory. External growth involves the business expanding outside its activities, commonly through mergers, acquisitions, or alliances with other businesses. This type of growth can enable a business to increase its market share, diversify its product offerings, or enter new markets more rapidly than internal growth.Financial Cost: Internal growth is relatively inexpensive; external growth has a higher economic cost.Risk: Internal growth is a less risky method of growth. External growth can entail higher risks.Control and Coordination: Internal growth allows the organisation to maintain control, whereas external growth can dilute control.Corporate Culture: Internal growth is the same. External growth can cause a culture clash.Slower, quicker: Internal growth could be faster to implement, whereas external growth is faster to increase production/sales.Talent Pool: Internal growth has a restricted talent pool.

External growth is more likely to show economies of scale.Sample response:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}Sample response:​Retained profits are the primary source of funding internal growth; therefore, there is negligible financing cost. The organisation might acquire an interest-bearing loan, but the size of this loan would be relatively small. Furthermore, borrowing costs would be more favourable due to the lower perceived risk.External growth often involves significant investment or financial outlay with an interest payment burden; the risk involved in external growth results in higher borrowing costs.Internal growth builds on the existing strengths of an organisation, such as brand value and customer loyalty. This factor, in combination with continuity in governance and management culture and the lower cost of funding growth, adds up to a lower risk.External growth can carry more risk due to a potential clash of management culture, a higher financial cost of growth and more significant uncertainties.Despite the risk involved, external growth is often favoured as it is a quicker method of increasing production/sales, often bringing the advantage of a greater pool of skills.Internal growth allows an organisation to maintain control and implement better coordination between departments. Internal growth is, therefore, easier to execute and manage.External growth dilutes control. It can lead to difficulty in coordination and result in inefficiencies.In internal growth, there is continuity of governance and corporate values, with no resulting clash of management styles.External growth can result in two organisations with vastly different management styles and cultures having to work together. The clash between these corporate cultures can lead to efficient management and effective decisions.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each difference.2 marksfor explaining each difference.Total- 4 marks",

        "markScheme": "Some of theopportunitiesa business operating overseas can benefit from are:Expanded customer base: Operating overseas allows the business to increase sales revenue by accessing a new customer base. This growth in market size is a significant advantage for businesses that experience saturation in their domestic markets or those looking to expand rapidly.Cheaper production cost: Expanding into some overseas markets can result in lower manufacturing costs for a business. In the fourth quarter of the last century, several big brand businesses started taking advantage of the improvements in infrastructure and the availability of a skilled workforce to set up manufacturing units in developing countries. The governments in these countries provided added economic incentives to attract MNCs.Access to resources: Another major incentive for an MNC to expand overseas is gaining access to raw materials. For example, it is more economical to ship 1 ton of extracted iron than 2 tons of iron ore. The cost of raw materials can be lower in countries with abundant raw materials. Overseas expansion can provide access to new technology. Some MNCs will set up overseas operations to acquire a qualified talent pool that would bring expertise and innovation into the business.Somethreatsan MNC can face when expanding overseas are:Political instability: An MNC can face problems caused by political instability and geopolitical friction in some foreign markets. Evolving politics in unstable but lucrative markets can have an adverse effect through a change in government policy or an economic slump. A new government might take away incentives the previous government provided, making the operation unviable. Geopolitical conflict can disrupt operations and cause financial losses.Cultural challenges: Differences in culture and language barriers can impede managing an overseas operation successfully. MNCs need to be aware of and adapt to local cultural norms. Local regulatory environments can be challenging, especially in countries with an evolving political system.Exchange rate: Fluctuations in exchange rates can affect profitability and even the viability of overseas operations. The cost of raw materials and the finished product prices can change rapidly, making it difficult to plan or guarantee cash flow and financial outcomes.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each oppotunity and threat.2 marksfor explaining each oppotunity and threat.Total- 4 marks",

The business operates a stylish coffee shop that serves ethically sourced coffee, baked goods, and light meals. What sets Second Chance Coffee apart is its mission: all its employees are either homeless or ex-prisoners, many of whom struggled to find stable employment.Lewis, a former social worker, launched the business to provide a supportive environment and help individuals reintegrate into society through employment, training, and mentorship. Although the coffee shop aims to make a profit, its social mission is at the heart of every decision. Lewis reinvests a portion of the profits into staff development and welfare programs.Despite a growing customer base, the business faces high training and support costs, and sometimes deals with challenges related to team management and social stigma.

There are language and cultural barriers between members, which sometimes lead to miscommunication and difficulties in decision-making. Additionally, while the cooperative recognises the need to invest in more modern machinery to improve productivity, obtaining additional funding has proven difficult due to limited access to finance and for rural businesses.In the local area, it is common for children not to finish primary education, as many end up working on farmland alongside their parents to support the family’s income.

These members may prefer financial stability over the uncertainty of continuing operations in a challenging market. Accepting the takeover would allow them to receive a guaranteed payment, helping them retire comfortably without worrying about the future performance of the cooperative.The shareholders of a publicly held company (PLC) are typically motivated by profit maximization and the expectation of regular dividends. To achieve this, the PLC is likely to prioritize cost reductions, which could include cutting jobs, reducing wages, or restructuring operations. This contrasts sharply with the objectives of the cooperative, which focuses on supporting its members' livelihoods and the local farming community. Therefore, younger members are justifiably concerned that a takeover would result in job losses and undermine their future security.Rejecting the takeover could help preserve local control over agriculture and protect the community’s interests. If the cooperative is taken over, decisions will likely be made by the PLC’s executives based on profit motives rather than the long-term well-being of small-scale farmers in Guatemala.

Customers who are loyal to GreenTech's environmentally sustainable mission may be disappointed if the company expands into fossil fuel sectors to meet the profit demands of investors. This could lead to a loss of customer loyalty and damage the company's brand reputation, while investors might see this diversification as a necessary step for increasing profitability.Mark allocation:Award[1]for each stakeholder conflict identified, up to a maximum of[2].Award[1]for each explanation of how the conflict might arise, applied to GreenTech’s situation, to a maximum of[2].Award a maximum of[4].Sample response:The shift towards fossil fuel investments could negatively impact GreenTech’s relationship with its customers.

These investors buy the company's stock through open stock markets.Disclosure Requirements: Publicly held companies must comply with several regulatory and reporting requirements, including the regulation that financial statements and public disclosures be filed regularly.Access to Capital: Public-held companies can readily obtain capital by offering more shares of their stock for sale to the general public, which can then be exchanged on stock markets.Ownership Liquidity: Investors benefit from the ease with which shareholders of publicly held companies can purchase and sell their shares on the open market.Key feature ofPrivate Held Company:Ownership: The shares of privately held companies are not listed on a public exchange and are usually owned by a smaller group of investors, such as the founders, family and friends.Disclosure Requirements: Since privately held businesses are exempt from the duty to disclose their financial information to the public, they are subject to less regulatory reporting requirements than publicly held companies.Access to money: Because privately held companies rely on loans, retained earnings, or private investments for finance, their access to money may be more constrained.Control and Decision-Making: Because privately held companies have fewer shareholders and are subject to less public scrutiny, their owners typically have more control over the day-to-day operations and decision-making of the business.Sample response:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}Sample response:​Despite their apparent similarities, publicly traded and privately held companies differ significantly in several crucial areas. Shares of publicly held companies are owned by a wide range of individuals, including large and regular investors who trade their shares on the stock exchange. They must share financial reports and information with the public, which can be a lot of work, to keep everyone informed about how they're doing. This implies they have many owners who can purchase or sell their shares fast, but it also makes it easier for them to make money by selling additional shares to the general public.On the other hand, the number of owners in privately held companies is lower. Since they don't offer shares to the general public, the company is governed by a small group of friends or family. They enjoy more privacy because they are not required to disclose their financial information to the public as often. However, because individuals can't just sell stock market shares when they need money, finding it can be more difficult. Owners typically have greater authority over the business, and selling or buying an ownership stake is more complex. Consequently, even if both types of businesses operate, their policies and procedures differ.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each difference.2 marksfor explaining each difference.Total- 4 marks",

A privately held company can easily access new markets, clientele, and technology through mergers and acquisitions (M&As), joint ventures, strategic alliances, or franchising. This acceleration might give the privately held company a competitive advantage, especially in fast-paced industries where getting products to market quickly is critical.On the other hand, external expansion tactics have some significant drawbacks, with cost being the main issue. M&As, joint ventures, and other external growth strategies are often more expensive than organic ones. Legal fees, transaction charges, integration costs, and the cost of buying already-existing assets or businesses may all be included in the costs. Furthermore, external development frequently involves a learning curve resulting in unanticipated operational or cultural difficulties. A privately held company's resources may be taxed by the costs and complications of external growth, necessitating careful planning, investigation, and risk management. For external expansion initiatives to be in line with the overall goals and long-term viability of the organisation, it is critical to strike a balance between expediency and financial ramifications.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each impact of growing externally for a privately held company.2 marksfor explaining each impact of growing externally for a privately held company.Total- 4 marks",

        "markScheme": "Advantages of being a partnership:Finance: Multiple owners invest in the company with a simple and inexpensive set-up.Specialised partners: Division of labour is possible as partners may specialise in specific company areas, improving productivity and efficiency.Privacy: Partnerships do not publish their financial records.Disadvantages of being a partnership:Continuity: When a partner leaves the partnership or passes away, the partnership needs to be completely set up again; this leads to a lack of continuity.Liability: Partnerships have unlimited liability. Therefore, partners are responsible for the company's debts, even if other partners encounter these.Decision-making: Decisions need to be made by the partners, which leads to a longer time for decisions to be made and agreed upon by all partners.Advantage 1:One advantage of being a partnership is the division of labour. Specialised work is possible since partners may focus on specific areas of the company and divide the company's tasks. With each partner focusing on specialised tasks, productivity and efficiency will likely improve, thus increasing profits and motivation.Advantage 2:A partnership will benefit from multiple owners investing in the company, leading to an increase in finance to set up and sustain the company. Also, setting up a partnership is simple, fast and inexpensive, an advantage of forming a partnership.Disadvantage 1:One disadvantage of being a partnership is having unlimited liability. With unlimited liability, all partners are responsible for the debts and legal issues encountered by the company, even if this is from one partner or if the company encounters a loss at some point. Therefore, partners must respond to the debts, which may affect their personal property if a debt is not paid out.Disadvantage 2:Disagreements in decision-making are disadvantages in partnerships; all of the members of a partnership need to agree on all decisions made before they are implemented. This will slow down the decision-making process, even if some of those decisions must be made fast, creating a communication problem and affecting the company's efficiency. This could also create a problem if not all partners agree.",

This goal is driven by the desire to reduce average production costs as production volumes increase.There are various types of economies of scale, categorised as internal and external economies of scale.Internal Economies of ScaleInternal economies of scale involve adopting new technologies to enhance productivity, accessing financing at lower interest rates, employing specialised staff to improve output quality and volume, spreading advertising costs over larger production quantities, and procuring inventory in bulk at reduced rates.External Economies of ScaleExternal economies of scale arise when a company gains access to new customer segments. For instance, an e-commerce business can significantly expand its customer base. Another example is when a company operates in an area with skilled workers, leading to lower recruitment and training expenses, thereby enhancing productivity and efficiency.Diseconomies of ScaleAs companies expand, their production capacity grows. However, if a company fails to operate close to its capacity, average costs and unit costs may rise, resulting in diseconomies of scale.Diseconomies of scale can be further categorized as internal and external.Internal Diseconomies of ScaleInternal diseconomies of scale often arise due to communication challenges, demotivation among staff from repetitive tasks and increased workloads, bureaucratic hurdles, and slower decision-making processes stemming from larger hierarchical structures, all of which can directly impact production levels.External Diseconomies of ScaleExternal diseconomies of scale occur when fixed costs escalate, including larger building rents due to increased production volumes and higher wages to retain skilled employees amidst increased job opportunities.",

Economies of scale, a crucial stage of growth, are identified by a number of distinctive characteristics. The most notable aspect is cost reduction—\\text{\\textemdash}—average manufacturing costs fall as operations' scale increases. This is a result of improved economies of scale-driven operational efficiencies, more effective resource utilisation, and reduced per-unit manufacturing costs. A business can offer items at more competitive pricing or of higher quality thanks to economies of scale, giving it a competitive edge and improving its market position and profitability.In contrast, certain crucial elements are at play when a corporation encounters diseconomies of scale. The development of increasingly complex and bureaucratic systems in larger organisations is one of the key contributing reasons. These frameworks may inhibit decision-making and impede efficiency, which limits adaptation.Another crucial element related to diseconomies of scale is adaptability. Organisations may become less able to respond to shifting consumer demands as they get bigger. It may be difficult to quickly pivot or modify tactics due to the growing complexity of operations and decision-making processes. The key distinctions between economies and diseconomies of scale highlight how crucial effective management and strategic decision-making are as a firm grows, as well as the careful balancing act needed to maximise benefits while minimising costs.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each difference.2 marksfor explaining each difference.Total- 4 marks",

The desire to grow their consumer base is one of the main motivators. Businesses can access new markets and demographics by going global and having a presence there. Through risk diversification, this not only increases their customer base but also lessens their reliance on a single market. Accessing a broader and more varied customer base can improve the stability of the company and present chances for long-term success.Another factor is the desire for lower production costs, a key driving force for companies aspiring to become MNCs. Businesses can take advantage of cost benefits in various regions by establishing operations in numerous nations. This can mean using more affordable raw resources, lower labour costs, or hospitable regulatory regimes in particular nations. Increased profitability is a result of lower manufacturing costs, which also provide businesses more freedom to compete successfully in price-sensitive markets. Cost-effective production can also lessen the effects of economic changes and improve a company's worldwide competitiveness, which promotes long-term success. In this approach, the drive to become an MNC is frequently a tactical response to the need to maximise market share and achieve cost reductions.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each reason.2 marksfor explaining each reason.Total- 4 marks",

It outlines the action to achieve its objectives and guides the decision-making process. A mission statement, though qualitative, should be clearly defined and achievable.A characteristic of vision statements is that they are stable and relevant in the long term. They can be refined from time to time, but the core message is consistent with the timeless values and goals of the organisation.On the other hand, a mission statement is frequently adjusted to suit changes in the business environment, including market conditions and trends.

It uses customisable, weather-resistant courts built with sustainably sourced materials. In 2024, PadelPro installed over 150 courts and earned €2.3 million in revenue.PadelPro offers end-to-end services, including design, installation, and maintenance.

Ethical objectives, defined by an organisation's moral guidelines and societal norms, play a pivotal role in shaping decision-making and can significantly influence the business's performance.One of the key advantages of having ethical objectives is the substantial improvement in the corporate image. When a company adheres to strong ethical principles, it is viewed more favourably by customers, employees, and the public. This positive perception can lead to increased trust, loyalty, and support from customers, resulting in a boost to the brand's reputation. A strong corporate image not only enhances market competitiveness but also paves the way for long-term sustainability. It is also noteworthy that improved corporate image often translates into higher profitability, as ethical businesses are more likely to attract a larger customer base.However, there are disadvantages as the implementation of ethical standards and practices can come with compliance costs, as businesses must allocate resources for ethical training, monitoring, and ensuring adherence to these standards. These costs can strain a company's financial resources, potentially leading to reduced short-term profits. In addition to compliance costs, adhering to stringent ethical standards may require changes to business processes and operations, which may not always align with short-term profitability objectives. This presents a complex dilemma for businesses as they navigate between the pursuit of ethical goals and the need to remain financially viable.In essence, while ethical objectives can enhance a company's corporate image and long-term sustainability, they may require financial sacrifices and present challenges for businesses in the short term.Mark Allocation:2 Marks: Identification of impacts (e.g., enhanced reputation, customer loyalty, operational challenges, etc.).2 Marks: Explanation of how these impacts influence the business (e.g., ethical practices attract socially conscious customers, increase costs, improve employee satisfaction, etc.).Total- 4 marks",

Foreign capital and expertise can stimulate economic growth and development, improving living standards and public infrastructure.Recognising that MNC influence can be two-sided because adverse effects can occur in host nations. The potential loss of jobs is one of these detrimental effects. Local labour may be displaced if MNCs adopt more effective production techniques or outsource specific tasks. Even though MNCs generate jobs, some will likely be lost due to the inability to adapt to the changing labour market, which could exacerbate income inequality and social problems. A percentage of the profits MNCs make in the host country are frequently sent back to the country where the company was founded. This could lead to a drain on the host country's financial resources, reducing the ability to reinvest earnings in local projects.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each impacts.2 marksfor explaining each impacts.Total- 4 marks",

A feature of CSR is that ecological considerations guide the decision-making process, and due care is taken to ensure business activities do not cause any damage to the environment. Organisations engage in green initiatives to reduce their ecological impact through using renewable energy, recycling, and reducing emissions.Many customers prefer patronising organisations known to follow environmentally sustainable practices.A key feature of CSR is engaging in local communities and participating in their development. Organisations set aside budgets to support charities and help with social causes. They donate funds and allocate resources to help alleviate social and humanitarian issues.Philanthropy is essential in enhancing an organisation's reputation in the eyes of customers and stakeholders, thus giving it an advantage over competitors.CSR confirms an organisation's transparency culture by disclosing information concerning their activities' social and environmental impact. Organisations publish reports disclosing their goals and initiatives in their drive towards sustainability and community development and often monitor compliance and progress in meeting their CSR goals.An organisation known to be transparent and honest in its dealing with environmental and social issues is looked upon favourably and trusted by customers, stakeholders and investors.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each feature.2 marksfor explaining each feature.Total- 4 marks",
