This allows a liquid to change its shape to fit its container while maintaining a fixed volume.  Since the particles remain in close contact, liquids are not compressible.  The particles do experience attractions to one aonther (intermolecular / interatomic forces) that must be overcome to enter into the gas phase.\n  The particles in a gas are in constant random motion, moving rabidly in all directions with negligible forces between them.

    "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\nIn paper chromatography, a solvent rises through the paper by capillary action and carries the components of a mixture with it. Different substances travel at different rates depending on their interactions with the paper and the solvent, producing a pattern of separated spots. The position of each spot can be expressed using the retention factor:\n$R_f = \\dfrac{\\text{distance moved by the spot}}{\\text{distance moved by the solvent front}}$\nRetention factors range between 0 and 1 and provide a way to compare spots.\nIn the chromatogram, the mixture has separated into four distinct spots. The same $R_f$ value is seen in both the mixture and standard X, showing that X is present. Similarly, both spots of standard Y are also present in the mixture, so Y is included as well. Standard Z, however, has two spots not both present in the mixture, so Z is not included. Although four spots are visible in the mixture, this only proves that it contains at least four components$\\text{---}$some spots may still contain more than one substance. Therefore, Statements I and II are correct, and Statement III is not.\nThis question is categorized as medium difficulty as students must recall how chromatography works and interpret results for a specific case.",

These energies correspond to the difference between allowed energy levels in the atom. When atoms absorb those photons, the electrons are excited to higher energy levels, and the absorbed wavelengths are missing from the observed spectrum, creating dark lines.\nSome answers might seem tempting but are incorrect. For example, photons are not emitted when electrons are excited because energy must be absorbed for an electron to move to a higher level. Likewise, when electrons fall to lower energy levels, they emit photons, which is how emission spectra are formed. Suggesting that photons are absorbed while electrons fall is inaccurate, since falling to a lower energy level releases energy rather than requiring it.",
