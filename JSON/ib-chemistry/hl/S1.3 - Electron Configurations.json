The arrow must begin at $n = 2$ and point to $n = 5$ to indicate the direction of the transition.\n  - Energy must be absorbed for the electron to move away from a position closer to the nucleus ($n = 2$) to a position further from the nucleus ($n = 5$). Therefore, the absorption spectrum would show the wavelength of light energy absorbed to cause this transition. $\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    Although the electron has more kinetic energy closer to the nucleus, the electron has more potential energy. Energy input (absorption) is required to move the electron away from the nucleus. The absorption spectrum would show a continuous spectrum with black lines (where the light is absorbed) at the wavelength corresponding to this particular transition.\n  - Visible light $\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    Transitions from higher energy levels to $n = 2$ represent the Balmer Series in the hydrogen atom and emit light in the visible spectrum. A transition in the opposite direction from $n = 2$ to a higher energy level will involve the same magnitude of energy, just absorbed rather than emitted.\n  - Shorter wavelength $\\checkmark$\n    $n = 4$ to $n = 1$ is a higher energy transition due to the greater distance to $n = 1$ resulting from the convergence of the energy levels. Higher energy corresponds to a shorter wavelength. $\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    On the diagram in part (i), the distance from  $n = 4$ to $n = 1$ is greater than the distance from $n = 2$ to $n = 5$, and therefore more energy is involved in the $4 \\longrightarrow 1$ transition.\n    Using the equations $E = hf$ and $c = \\lambda f$, one can see that energy and frequency are directly related, but frequency and wavelength are inversely related. Therefore, energy and wavelength are inversely related. The energy increases, so the wavelength decreases.\n\n- \n  - $(1228\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1})(\\dfrac{1000\\,\\text{J}}{1\\,\\text{kJ}})(\\dfrac{1\\,\\text{mol}}{6.02\\times 10^{23}}) = \\answer{2.040\\times 10^{-18}\\,\\text{J}}\\,\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    The energy value provided states the energy for a mole of electrons  (kJ mol$^{-1}$) undergoing this energy transition. The calculation involves converting $kJ$ to $J$ and dividing  by Avagadro's constant to determine the energy value for a single electron.\n  - $\\lambda = \\dfrac{hc}{E} = \\dfrac{(6.63\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\text{J s})(3.00\\times 10^8\\,\\text{m s}^{-1})}{(2.040\\times 10^{-18}\\,\\text{J})} = \\answer{9.750\\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}}\\,\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    The calculation involves the equations, $E = hf$ and $c = \\lambda f$\n  - Ultraviolet $\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    Using the electromagnetic spectrum (table 3 in the data booklet), a wavelength with the magnitude $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ would fall in the UV portion of the spectrum.\n  - Transitions between energy levels within the atom involve specific amounts of energy. The transition from $4 \\longrightarrow 1$ in the hydrogen atom will always emit the same amount of energy and produce the same spectral line. $\\checkmark$\n    The photons emitted by the transition $4 \\longrightarrow 1$ are of a specific frequency and have discrete values because the electrons in the energy levels hold specific amounts of energy. $\\checkmark$\n    The response should describe the Bohr concept that the electrons reside in specific energy levels and therefore have specific amounts of energy. As they transition to lower energy levels as in 4 $\\longrightarrow$ 1, photons are emitted with discrete amounts of energy having specific wavelengths and frequencies, they are said to be quantized.\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\n    The Bohr model puts electrons in specific energy levels, Their energy in any particular level can be calculated. In the hydrogen atom, transitions from higher to lower energy levels emit photons of light of specific wavelength and frequency, they therefore carry an exact or discrete amount of energy and are quantized.\n\n",

For Na, $\\ce{IE}_1$ removes the $3s$ electron; $\\ce{IE}_2$ begins removing $n=2$ core electrons.

An element's successive ionization energies increase as more energy is needed to remove electrons.  As the ion becomes more positive, it will take more energy to remove the next electron.  Successive ionization energies always increase. When the next electron is in a shell closer to the nucleus, the successive ionization energy will increase sharply because there is less shielding of the nuclear charge and because the distance between the electron and nucleus is smaller.\nIn the table provided, the largest jump in the ionization energy for element X occurs between $IE_1$ (first ionization energy) and $IE_2$ (second ionization energy). This must correspond to a change in energy level. So, the atom of the element must have one valence electron and belong to group 1. In the case of Y, the largest jump in the ionization energy occurs between $IE_6$ (sixth ionization energy) and $IE_7$ (seventh ionization energy). So, the atom of the element must have six valence electrons and belong to group 16.\nX forms cations with one positive charge whereas Y forms ions with two negative charges.

However, the data also show irregularities that can only be explained by sublevels. The first occurs between magnesium and aluminium: in aluminium, the electron removed is from a $3p$ orbital, which lies at slightly higher energy and is shielded by the inner 3s orbital. This makes it easier to remove than the $3s$ electron in magnesium. A second dip occurs between phosphorus and sulfur. Phosphorus has three unpaired $3p$ electrons, but sulfur has a fourth $3p$ electron that must pair with one of the others. The repulsion between two electrons in the same orbital lowers the energy required to remove one, creating the observed decrease. These two dips are direct experimental evidence that period 3 contains both $3s$ and $3p$ sublevels.\n  - Ar has highest effective nuclear charge , same shielding $\\checkmark$\n    $\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}$:\nArgon lies at the end of period 3, where the nuclear charge is greatest. Its outer electrons are still in the $n=3$ shell, but they experience a strong effective nuclear charge because shielding from inner electrons is relatively constant across the period. This strong attraction between nucleus and outer $3p$ electrons requires much more energy to remove them, so argon shows the highest first ionization energy of period 3.\n\n",

      "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\nTo answer this question, students must differentiate emission (electrons decaying to a lower energy level) from absorption (electrons promoted to higher energy levels).\nStudents should also recall the relationship between frequency and energy ($E \\propto f$). The highest frequency corresponds to the highesy energy transition.  According to the Bohr model, thediscrete energy levels in the hydrogen spectrum converge at higher energies. Of the three emissions proposed, the one with the greatest frequency/energy is $n=7 \\longrightarrow n=1.$\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/89299878-7c02-447d-9568-fe86fcf00643/images/1fae25df-afde-432d-9d9e-b4c45710afca/CH0994.JPEG)\n\n\nThis question is categorized as hard as students compare transitions based on their knowledge of the hydrogen energy level diagram.",

      "markScheme": "C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation:}}$\nThe electronic energy levels for the hydrogen atom converge at high energy (furthest from the nucleus), where $n = 1$ is closest to the nucleus. A simple diagram can be drawn to show the relative energy levels.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/e38802a0-9d42-4913-b9b7-de2c97c3a807/images/a330f257-07c0-49ca-84ff-4a03ecd5af38/CH2032.png)\n\n\nEach transition is indicated with an arrow, where the longest arrow equates to the highest energy. Energy and the wavelength of light are inversely proportional as follows:\n$E = \\dfrac{hc}{\\lambda}$\nTherefore, a higher energy has a lower wavelength (and vice versa). For this question, we are looking for the shortest arrow which is the lowest energy and the longest wavelength (so, $n= 5$ to $n = 4).$",
