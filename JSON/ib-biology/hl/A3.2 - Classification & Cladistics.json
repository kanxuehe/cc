Choice B is, therefore, correct.\nRadioactive dating is a method used to date rocks and other materials based on the known decay rates of radioactive isotopes. Choice A is, therefore, not correct.\nComparative anatomy involves comparing the structures of different organisms to understand their evolutionary relationships. While it can provide evidence of common ancestry and evolutionary trends, it does not offer a precise method for estimating the time of divergence between species based on genetic differences. Choice C is, therefore, not correct.\nStudying the distribution of fossils within sedimentary rock layers establishes relative ages and the chronological order of geological and evolutionary events. Whilst it is essential for constructing the timeline of life on Earth, it does not use genetic differences to estimate divergence times between species. Choice D is, therefore, not correct.",

      "markScheme": "C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nMorphological traits, or structures, are useful for creating cladograms. However, cladograms created by comparing such traits may be inaccurate because distantly related organisms can have structures that appear similar but have different genetic bases. The appearance of similar structures with a different evolutionary basis is not evidence of relatedness, but rather is evidence of convergent evolution. So, one reason the cladogram based on the DNA sequences is more reliable than the cladogram based on structures is that similar structures can be coded for by different genes in genetically distant organisms.\nChoice A is incorrect because structures are inherited when species diverge, and the inheritance of structures is beneficial for constructing cladograms.  This is because shared structures are sometimes, but not always, evidence of genetic relatedness.\nChoice B is incorrect because DNA does change over time. Scientists look at sequences of changes in DNA to determine evolutionary relatedness.\nChoice D is incorrect because different structures are generally coded for by different DNA sequences.",

      "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nBoth cladograms show the relationships among arachnids and organisms related to arachnids. Cladogram 1 shows sea spiders and horseshoe crabs as related to, but not members, of the arachnids. Horseshoe crabs therefore form a sister group to the arachnids (A sister group is the closest relative to a given unit in a cladogram). Cladogram 2 shows horseshoe crabs as a group within the arachnids.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/9f58f8ff-0c6d-45ec-b83b-b630124d062a/images/fc803d09-abaa-4f4e-bdb8-31f8b7aab5c1/BI0510A.png)\n\n\nSo, Cladogram 2 indicates that horseshoe crabs are a group within the arachnids, a relationship not indicated by Cladogram 1.\nCladogram 1, not Cladogram 2, indicates that horseshoe crabs are a sister group of arachnids (Choice A). Both cladograms show that sea spiders were an ancestor of arachnids (Choices C and D).",
