Sympatric speciation is the evolution of a new species from an existing one without geographical isolation (sympatric actually means ‘same geographical area’). The factors that can cause this type of speciation include behavioural and temporal isolation.Choice Cis, therefore, correct because temporal isolation is common in sympatric speciation, and geographic isolation leads to allopatric speciation.Choice Ais incorrect because although behavioural isolation can lead to sympatric speciation, polyploidy does not lead directly to allopatric speciation.Choice Bis incorrect because geographical isolation is not part of the process of sympatric speciation, and, temporal isolation does not directly lead to allopatric speciation.Choice Dis incorrect because geographic isolation is not part of the process of sympatric speciation, and polyploidy does not lead directly to allopatric speciation.",

In this question they are in the same location, therefore this is incorrect. Stabilising selection (Choice C) is a type of natural selection that promotes an intermediate phenotype, so extremes are reduced, and it does not result in speciation. Directional selection (Choice D) is a type of natural selection that promotes an extreme phenotype, but the selection is in one direction so it does not divide the population and so does not lead to speciation.

In fact, their function may differ considerably, for example, the forelimbs of bats for flight versus the flippers of dolphins for swimming.

Both bats and dolphins have a pentadactyl limb structure in their forelimbs, despite a differing external appearance and function. This reflects divergent evolution from a shared ancestor;Statement IIis true.Bat wings and insect wings are analogous structures.

      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Allopolyploidy arises from hybridisation between two different species, followed by chromosome doubling.

New alleles are introduced into a species, giving an immediate selective advantage to that plant species.Choice Bis incorrect because allopolyploidy allows new varieties that are well adapted to different local abiotic and biotic conditions. This characteristic can explain the widespread global cultivation of wheat (Triticum aestivum) as a staple crop.Choice Dis incorrect because the new alleles brought in from new species allow a species to compete in a territory or habitat that it had not otherwise been successful in, allowing an invasive species to outcompete the native species in many cases.",

This is, therefore, an example of polyploidy and sympatric speciation.Choice Ais incorrect because, although bonobos and chimpanzees were geographically isolated from each other (allopatric speciation), there was no increase in the chromosome number during the speciation event.Choice Cis incorrect because the lava fields geographically isolated the tortoises, leading to sub-species forming. This is, therefore, an ongoing allopatric speciation event, not sympatric, and it does not involve polyploidy. The tetraploid frog resulted from a polyploidy speciation event that resulted in reproductive isolation.

These epigenetic changes can be passed to offspring, but often only persist for a few generations and typically do not lead to long-term evolutionary change.Choice Ais incorrect because neither Lamarckism nor epigenetic inheritance involves changes to the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetics modifies gene expression through chemical tags, while Lamarckism assumed physical or behavioural changes were inherited.Choice Cis incorrect because only Lamarckism proposed that the use or disuse of traits directly causes evolutionary change.
