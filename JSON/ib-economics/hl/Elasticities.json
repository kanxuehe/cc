      "markScheme": "Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:Price elasticity of supply (PES)measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity supplied of a product due to a change in its price[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}[T].PES is calculated using the formula:\\hspace{1em}=%change in quantity supplied%change in price= \\dfrac{\\%\\ \\textrm{change in quantity supplied}}{\\%\\ \\textrm{change in price}}=%change in price%change in quantity supplied​Goods and services have PES values ranging from zero to infinity but the most common ones found in real life would beelasticandinelastic supply. If a product has an elastic supply, a change in price leads to a greater than proportionate change in the quantity supplied, and the value of PES will be greater than 1. Whereas if a product has an inelastic supply then a change in price leads to a less than proportionate change in the quantity supplied, so the value of PES will be less than 1.The time to respond to price changes affects the price elasticity of supply for a product[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. Supply tends to be price inelastic in the short run as firms do not necessarily have the resources to increase their output owing to the length of the production process[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. The supply of fruits and vegetables is dependent on the time taken for growing and harvesting these products. Therefore supply of these products would be inelastic as the quantity supplied cannot be increased following an increase in price. Any increase in price will only lead to a less than proportionate change in quantity supplied making them relatively price inelastic[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].In contrast, mass-produced goods like canned drinks, bottled water are relatively price elastic in the short run as firms can adjust their factors of production to increase their production. Any increase in price will lead to a greater than proportionate change in quantity supplied making them relatively price elastic.Similarly in the long run most of the firms will be able to adjust their factors of production according to changes in the prices. This would make them more elastic in the long run[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].The mobility of factors of production, which refers to the level of ease and cost of factor mobility and substitution in theproduction process, also affects PES[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. If factors of production can be easily diverted/substituted, producers can adjust supply in response to changes in price and thus the supply would be relatively elastic[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. For example, if the price of tomatoes increases in comparison to carrots, then producers can divert factors of production used to grow carrots—arable farmland and farm equipment—to the production of tomatoes[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].By contrast, if resources cannot be easily moved to the production of another good or service, then producers are not able to bring significant changes in the quantity supplied. This makes the supply of goods less responsive to changes in the price, thereby making the goods relative price inelastic[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].Explanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Terminology[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}Terminology[T]For correctly using the term\"\"\"PES\"\"\"by linking that it is a measure of the degree of responsiveness of quantity supplied of a product due to a change in its price.

The opposite is true for products that cannot be easily stored.Rate at which costs risefor identifying the determinant (✓\\checkmark✓)for stating that PES is relatively inelastic if production costs rise quickly (✓\\checkmark✓), and relatively elastic if production costs rise slowly (✓\\checkmark✓)for explaining why PES varies depending on how quickly costs rise (✓\\checkmark✓)e.g. If the cost of producing additional output rises more slowly than the price of the product, firms' profits increase and firms will produce more. But If the cost of producing additional output rises rapidly, then profits will not increase greatly, so firms will not increase supply greatly.[8 maximum][= 10 maximum]",

The formula below can be used to calculate a product's PED:\\hspace{1em}PED=%change in quantity demanded%change in pricePED = \\dfrac{\\%\\ \\textrm{change in quantity demanded}}{\\%\\ \\textrm{change in price}}PED=%change in price%change in quantity demanded​The percentage change in the quantity demanded for a product in response to a given percentage change in its price is dependent on a number of determinants.

That is, a given percentage increase in the price of the good produces amore than proportionatepercentage decrease in the quantity demanded for that good. Price elastic products have anabsolutePED value that exceeds 1 (ie., PED>\\gt>1) and a relatively flat demand curve (Figure 1). If the price of, for example, a Toyota sedan increases, consumers have a large number of cheaper substitutes available to buy from, such as sedans manufactured by Honda. And so, a 10%\\%%increase in the price of a Toyota sedan (fromP1P_1P1​toP2P_2P2​in Figure 1) may produce a 15%\\%%decrease in the quantity demanded for this car (fromQ1Q_1Q1​toQ2Q_2Q2​)[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D]as consumers substitute towards the relatively cheaper Honda sedans[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. Relatedly, if consumers perceive Toyota and Honda sedans to beclosesubstitutes, the PED value for a Toyota sedan will be larger than 1.5 (15%\\%%decrease in quantity demanded divided by a 10%\\%%increase in price) and, thus, more price elastic.\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/57819386-d5ab-4970-be5e-1bb6407b9a38/images/5384b2b7-767a-409b-af27-cf6200423c24/EC0384a.2.JPG)\n\nSecond, the demand for a product with a high degree of necessity is price inelastic[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. That is, a given percentage increase in the price of the good produces aless than proportionatepercentage decrease in the quantity demanded for that good. Price inelastic products have an absolute PED value that is greater than 0 but less than 1 (ie., 0<<<PED<<<1) and a relatively steep demand curve (Figure 2). Semiconductors, for instance, are an essential input in the production of many consumer durable goods, like cars and home appliances[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. A 10%\\%%increase in the price of semiconductors (fromP1P_1P1​toP2P_2P2​in Figure 2), therefore, may only produce an 8%\\%%decrease in the quantity demanded (Q2Q_2Q2​toQ1Q_1Q1​)[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D][EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. In addition to their necessity in the production of many electronic goods, semiconductors have no close substitutes, which further contributes to their low absolute PED value. Relatedly, certain products may derive their high degree of necessity from their addictive nature. It is the nicotine in cigarettes, for example, that creates a high degree of dependence among its consumers. The more addictive the product is, the smaller its absolute PED value.In the short run, consumers are less responsive to a change in the price of a product if the good/service has a high degree of necessity and little to no close substitutes available.Explanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Terminology[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}Terminology[T]For correctly using the term‘`‘price elasticity of demand' by indicating that it refers to changes in quantity demanded following a change in priceorproviding the correct formula.

      "markScheme": "Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:A firm'srevenuedepends on the number of products it sells and the average price of the product it sells. When a firm changes the price of its product, product sales will be affected according to the law of demand[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. But, these impacts differ depending on thedeterminants of price elasticity of demand(PED)[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}[T]for the good.One determinant of PED is consumers'time to respondwhen buying airline tickets: airfare is usually more expensive if buying it within a few days of the date of travel. For example, a business traveller needing to see a client may have little time to shop for a less expensive ticket and will be willing to pay a higher price[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE]. Hence, airlines can increase revenue by keeping the price of tickets high[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]when the date of travel is only a few days away.\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/1a97ab1e-6eaf-4f87-94e5-2ef6c4652abd/images/c1a61e59-97e9-4f02-83b9-602cee7cfb0d/EC0376b.JPG)\n\nWhen the time to respond is low, PED is moreinelastic(its value is lower).  In the diagram above, the demand curve is relatively inelastic, and increasing price (P1P_1P1​toP2P_2P2​) increasestotal revenue(A+B<B+CA + B < B + CA+B<B+C)[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D].\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/1a97ab1e-6eaf-4f87-94e5-2ef6c4652abd/images/b2d310ff-656d-41af-8b81-19fe8988a6dc/EC0376b.2.JPG)\n\nBut, when consumers have more time to find a better deal, airlines can increase revenue by lowering ticket prices[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. This is because the time to respond is greater, and PED increases—\\text{\\textemdash}—it becomes moreelastic—\\text{\\textemdash}—for this reason. In other words, because consumers shopping for leisure travel have more time to find a better deal or decide against travelling at all, they are more price-sensitive than business travellers[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE].  In the diagram above, the demand curve is relatively more elastic, and lowering the price (P1P_1P1​toP2P_2P2​) increases total revenue(A+B<B+C(A+B < B+C(A+B<B+C)[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D].Consequently, an airline wishing to maximise revenue should increase prices when the PED is inelastic and decrease prices when the PED is elastic. However, there are several assumptions that airlines should also consider. For example, commercial airlines have limited capacity[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E]: their planes have a fixed number of seats, and airlines cannot change their routes easily[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE]. So, if airlines set the price too low, filling their seats with leisure travellers, they give up the opportunity to sell more expensive tickets to business travellers. But, if they set the price too high, they risk not selling all the available seats, and losing out on potential revenue. To maximise revenue, airlines must have a finely-tuned understanding of how the PED of their customers varies[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E].Another problem is that business travellers are not the only consumers who need to travel on short notice[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE]. In particular, in the case of natural disasters, humanitarian crises, or family emergencies, air travellers often need to make travel plans quickly. Maximising revenue by charging high prices to these consumers can be seen as price gouging, which may hurt the airline's reputation (and ticket sales) over time[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E].Perhaps this explains why airlines increasingly use additional methods to increase revenue, such as dividing the cabin into additional fare tiers or charging for baggage, meals, or the ability to choose one's seat[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE]. In these practices, airlines are able to extract more revenue from less price-sensitive customers without having to only rely on response time to increase or decrease their revenue.Explanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Terminology[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}Terminology[T]For correctly using the termprice elasticity of demandby indicating that it is the degree to which the quantity demanded changes in response to a change in price.

A value less than 1 means supply isprice inelastic—producers are less sensitive to price changes. PES can be affected byfactorssuch as the ability to store stocks, time period, type of production method, mobility of factors of production, and using underemployed resources[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].The PES forprimary commoditiesis relatively low due to the comparatively long time it takes to increase primary sector production such as agricultural products. However, the PES formanufactured goods(like shoes) is higher as many of these can be mass-produced in less time. Additionally, even though it’s possible to store primary output like wheat, such goods are perishable and can be damaged[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. This makes it difficult to hold stocks of primary goods over time. However, manufactured goods such as furniture can be stored for longer. Such goods may become outdated, but they do not perish over time like primary commodities. Thus, the PES of manufactured goods tends to be higher than that of primary commodities because manufacturers can release stored inventory when the price increases[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].Furthermore,capital-intensive production in the manufacturing sector means it is relatively easy to raise output, while production tends to be land-intensive in the primary sector[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. Land is fixed in supply—once crops have been planted, the capacity is effectively fixed, at least in theshort run. Additionally, labour-intensive\nproduction in the primary sector can be costly, which limits the ability of firms to increase output despite price hikes[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].This can be understood by comparing supply curves for both primary commodities and manufactured goods.

The shortage of safe carbon dioxide will cause a rise in the price of soda for consumers. This is because the shortage ofCO2\\mathrm{CO_2}CO2​will cause the suppliers to have to charge more for every given quantity of soda they are able to supply.

      "markScheme": "Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:In an effort to increase tax revenues, governments resort to levying indirect taxes, which are taxes on the sale of goods and services[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}[T]. Decisions about which goods or services a government should tax for the purpose of increasing tax revenue can largely be dependent on the price elasticity of demand (PED) for these products. PED is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded for a good or service to a change in its price,ceteris paribus[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}[T].\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/5865564d-6c69-4499-9f3b-b528ff519c9e/images/6f39cc7a-0b87-47c3-b2e8-aee3a9dfe62e/EC0384b.JPG)\n\nSince 2018, the Irish government has levied an indirect tax, known as the Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax, on the sale of sugary drinks, such as soft drinks[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE]. In Figure 1, the relatively steep demand curve for high-sugar soft drinks stems from its lowabsolutePED value. The demand for sugary drinks is price inelastic largely because of its high degree of necessity. Specifically, consumers form a dependency on sugary drinks because sugar is addictive[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].Imposing an indirect tax of 30c per litre on soft drinks has the effect of raising drinks manufacturers' cost of production, which causes a leftward shift of the supply curve for soft drinks fromS1S_1S1​toS2S_2S2​[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D]. Despite the increase in price of soft drinks fromPMP_MPM​toPCP_CPC​, there is aless than proportionatedecrease in the quantity demanded for this addictive product (QMQ_MQM​toQTQ_TQT​). The gain in revenue from selling the sugary drink at a higher price (PCP_CPC​>>>PMP_MPM​) is greater than the loss of revenue from selling fewer units of soft drinks (QTQ_TQT​<<<QMQ_MQM​)[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. This revenue, equivalent to areas a+++b+++d or ((PCP_CPC​−-−PPP_PPP​)xxxQTQ_TQT​), is collected by the Irish government as tax[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D]. In 2022, the Irish government collected€\\euro€32 million in tax revenues from the sugar tax alone, accomplishing the goal of raising government revenue[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E].Despite the possibility of collecting large volumes of tax revenues, the loss of total revenue earned by drinks manufacturers may be harmful to a government. At the free market equilibrium (point X), total revenue earned by firms is equal to areas d+++e+++f+++g+++h (orPMP_MPM​xxxQMQ_MQM​). Levying an indirect tax, however, moves the market to a new, after-tax equilibrium at point Y. As the indirect tax lowers the price received by producers fromPMP_MPM​toPPP_PPP​and lowers the quantity of output sold fromQMQ_MQM​toQTQ_TQT​, drinks manufacturers experience a fall in total revenue, which is now equal to areas f+++g (orPPP_PPP​xxxQTQ_TQT​). If producers' costs of production remain unchanged, the reduced profits earned by drinks manufacturers lowers the direct corporate taxes collected by the government.Additionally, drink manufacturers may respond to this loss of profitability by firing workers. In response, a government may use scarce tax revenues to support these unemployed workers. And so, despite the relatively large tax revenues earned from imposing the indirect tax on a specific good with a low PED, governments may experience a loss of tax revenues from struggling firms and unemployed workers.Governments must also pay heed to the impact of time on the size of these tax revenues collected. If the price of these taxed goods remain elevated for a long period of time, their low PED values will eventually become bigger in the long run, causing a fall in tax revenues collected. This was the experience for the Canadian province of Quebec in 2023 where persistently high cigarette prices (from taxes) prompted consumers to substitute cheaper tobacco alternatives, like vapes or e-cigarettes[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE]. Therefore, over the long run, governments must account for dwindling tax revenues collected from taxing price inelastic products as newer, often unregulated, substitute products eventually enter the market[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E].\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/5865564d-6c69-4499-9f3b-b528ff519c9e/images/e5dc0a4e-62cb-4d83-8498-e17dbf1c6cbc/EC0384b.2.JPG)\n\nIt is imprudent for governments to tax goods or services with high PEDs if their objective is to increase tax revenues. The Norwegian government should, therefore, reconsider its proposal to impose an indirect tax on luxury electric cars, like Porsche and Jaguar, for the purpose of increasing tax revenues[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE]. In Figure 2, the relatively flat demand curve for luxury cars stems from its high absolute PED value. The demand for luxury vehicles, even in a high-income country like Norway, is price elastic because it accounts for a large proportion of a consumer's income. The availability of close substitutes, like generic electric vehicles, further contribute to its high PED value as consumers can substitute towards cheaper alternatives[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. This can be seen in Figure 2 where the increase in price of luxury cars fromPMP_MPM​toPCP_CPC​produces amore than proportionatedecrease in the quantity demanded for this luxury good (QMQ_MQM​toQTQ_TQT​). This revenue, equivalent to areas a+++b+++d or ((PCP_CPC​−-−PPP_PPP​)xxxQTQ_TQT​), is collected by the government as tax.The loss of revenue from the fewer units of luxury cars sold (QTQ_TQT​<<<QMQ_MQM​) exceeds the gain in revenue from selling the luxury car at a higher price (PCP_CPC​>>>PMP_MPM​). This helps explain why the government revenue collected from taxing a price elastic good is smaller than the government revenue earned from taxing a price inelastic good, like soft drinks[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. The tax revenue area in Figure 1 is larger than the tax revenue area in Figure 2.If the main objective is to increase tax revenue, governments should levy indirect taxes on goods with low absolute PED values. The Irish government's indirect tax on sugary drinks, for example, is a prudent policy used to increase tax revenues; however, policymakers should contend with the possibility of negative employment effects on the taxed industry and the increasing PED value of taxed goods over the long run[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E].Explanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Terminology[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}Terminology[T]For correctly using the term‘`‘price elasticity of demand' by indicating that it refers to changes in quantity demanded following a change in priceorproviding the correct formulaand‘`‘indirect tax' by indicating that it is a tax on the sale of goods and services.

Machinery used to produce men’s shirts could also be used to produce women’s dresses at short notice, while equipment used in agriculture, like combine harvesters, or in mining, like large drills are more specialised, and cannot be used to produce something else, even if demand for that other good were to increase rapidly.Solution‾\\underline{\\textrm{Solution}}Solution​:For an explanation includingtwoof the reasons below (a-e):a. It takes longer to produce (✓\\checkmark✓) primary goods than secondary goods (✓\\checkmark✓).orb. Agricultural output tends to be perishable (✓\\checkmark✓), while manufactured goods are not, so the PES for manufactured goods tends to be higher as they can be stored when demand is low, and released to the market when demand is high (✓\\checkmark✓).orc. Marginal costs for manufactured goods tend to be lower than for primary commodities(✓\\checkmark✓), which makes the supply of primary goods less responsive as it is more costly to increase production(✓\\checkmark✓).ord. Capital equipment in manufacturing is substitutable (✓\\checkmark✓), while equipment in primary production is more specialised (✓\\checkmark✓).ore. Manufacturing is more capital-intensive (✓\\checkmark✓), while primary products are land-intensive. Land is fixed, while more capital goods can be acquired if needed (✓\\checkmark✓).",
