    "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\nDue to symmetry, the final velocities $V$ of the balls will be the same. We can see this as the masses are the same and the magnitude of the vertical components of the velocity must be the same due to conservation of vertical momentum.\nImpulse ($J$) is equal to change in momentum. The simplest way to find the impulse of this collision is to consider the change in momentum of the ball that is initially stationary.\n\n\n- $J=m\\Delta v$\n\nWe can find the horizontal component of this velocity $V_H$ using conservation of momentum. Setting the horizontal momentum before the collision equal to the horizontal momentum after the collision:\n\n\n- $mv+0=mV_H+mV_H$\n- $mv=2mV_H$\n- $V_H=\\dfrac{v}{2}$\n\nAfter the collision, the balls move at 45° (so the vector triangle is isosceles) so the magnitude of the vertical component of the balls' final velocity is equal to the horizontal component\n\n\n- $V_V=V_H=\\dfrac{v}{2}$.\n\nNow $V$ is the vector sum of $V_H$ and $V_V$, which can be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem:\n\n\n- $V=\\sqrt{V_H^2+V_V^2}=\\sqrt{\\left(\\dfrac{v}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\dfrac{v}{2}\\right)^2}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{v^2}{2}}=\\dfrac{v}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nBecause the ball was initally stationary, this also represents the change in velocity of the ball.

Due to the absence of a vertical force, there will be no change in the vertical component of the momentum of the ball, and all of the momentum change is in the horizontal direction.\nBecause the collision is elastic, the speed of the ball is unchanged in the collision. As the vertical component of the velocity is unchanged, it follows that the magnitude of the horizontal component of the velocity is also unchanged.\nGiven that the magnitudes of the components are both unchanged, the angles $\\theta_1\\ $and $\\theta_2$ must be equal.\nIt has been determined that the only change in momentum is in the horizontal direction.\nTherefore,\n\n\n- $∆p_h=p_{fh}-p_{ih}$\n- $p_{ih}=mv\\,(\\sin\\,\\theta_1)$\n\nand\n\n\n- $p_{fh}=-mv(\\sin\\,\\theta_2)$\n- $\\Delta p_h=p_{fh}-p_{ih}=-mv\\sin\\,θ_2-mv\\sin\\,θ_1$\n\nBut\n\n\n- $\\theta_1=\\theta_2$\n\nTherefore\n\n\n- $\\Delta p_h=-2mv(\\sin\\,θ_1)$\n\nThus\n\n\n- $\\Delta p=-2mv(\\sin\\,θ_1)$\n",
