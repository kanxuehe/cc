      "content": "Emily is training for a triathlon and cycles at a speed of\n20 km/hr for 15 minutes followed by $t$ hours\nrunning at a speed of 15 km/hr.\n\n\nShow that a function to model her average speed $S(t)$ is given by\n[2]\n\n$$$S(t)=1+4t20+60t​.​$$$\n\n\nFind $S−1(t)$.[2]\n\n\n\nHence find the time, $t$, if the average speed Emily travels at is\n16 km/hr.[2]\n\n\n",
      "markScheme": "\n\nLet's denote the path she cycles at 20 km/hr\nby $A$, and the running path at 15 km/hr by\n$B$.\n\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/8f827a7c-24a2-40b1-90d9-68752b6dd2e8/images/d63f160d-16e2-4fbf-8d6f-d331f12f3279/18f8e72209382b1575d513cf1f3df1aca73bd68e.svg)\n\n\nThe distance Emily travels during the cycle ($A$) in km can be found by\n$$$dA​​=VA​tA​=(20)(41​)=5​$$$\nSimilarly, the distance Emily travels during the run ($B$) can be expressed as\n$$$dB​​=VB​tB​=15t​$$$\nHence, we can find the average speed in terms of $t$ as follows\n$$$S(t)​=tA​+tB​dA​+dB​​=41​+t5+15t​=41+4t​5+15t​S(t)=1+4t20+60t​​(1)​$$$\n\n\nWe can find the inverse of S(t) by using expression (1), changing\n$S(t)$ to $y$, interchanging $t$ and $y$, and then rearranging for\n$y$. We get\n$$$yt20+60y(60−4t)yyHence, the inverse function is​=1+4t20+60t​=1+4y20+60y​=t+4ty=t−20=60−4tt−20​S−1(t)=60−4tt−20​​​$$$\n\n\nThe time $t$ she has to run to get an average speed of\n16 km/hr is $S−1(16)$. Hence, we get\n$$$S−1(16)=60−4(16)16−20​=1.​$$$\n\n",
