    markScheme:
      'C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nStatement I is true because cohesion refers to the attraction between water molecules due to hydrogen bonding. This cohesive property allows the water column to behave as a continuous stream, enabling tension created by transpiration at the leaves to be transmitted all the way down the xylem. This is central to the cohesion-tension theory of water transport.\nStatement II is false because cohesion actually resists evaporation. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules make it harder for individual molecules to escape into the air. Evaporation is more closely influenced by temperature and humidity, not directly by cohesion.\nStatement III is true because adhesion is the attraction between water molecules and the walls of the xylem vessel. This helps to counteract gravity and supports the column, reducing the chance of it breaking, especially under tension during transpiration. So this contributes to the integrity of the water column.\nChoice C is therefore the correct answer because it only includes the two true Statements I and III.\nChoice A is incorrect as it is missing the true Statement III.\nChoices B and D are incorrect as they include the false Statement II.',

    markScheme:
      "D\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nThe oldest meteorites in our solar system have been found to contain ice and hydrated minerals. Hydrated minerals contain water in their crystal structures. Hydrated minerals originating from meteorites can become dehydrated through heating, releasing water vapour into the surroundings and leaving behind anhydrous minerals; Choice D is correct.\nWater molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen atoms, each of which can exist as different isotopes. In planetary science, scientists compare the ratios of these isotopes (such as the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio or the $^{18}O/^{16}O$ ratio) to trace the origin of water.\nChoice A is incorrect because it implies that meteorites contain ice with exactly the same isotopes as those in Earth’s oceans. In reality, all water contains the same possible isotopes, but the key evidence lies in the relative proportions of these isotopes. Some meteorites contain water with a similar isotopic ratio to Earth's oceans, not an identical isotopic composition. Therefore, the claim is misleading.\nCohesion is a process that does not require anything but water molecules, it is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Some evidence of amino acids has been found in meteorites, but no evidence of polypeptides. Choice B is incorrect.\nMeteorites travel through the vacuum of space, where temperatures are far too low to sustain liquid water. Also, no compelling evidence exists that meteorite-bound water has similar salinity to Earth's oceans.; Choice C is incorrect.",

In summer water absorbs heat energy and then in winter this heat energy is lost to the surrounding air helping to create milder microclimates. This enables the black-throated loon to inhabit areas where temperature might otherwise be too extreme.\nChoice B is incorrect because it does not explain how winter air temperatures are made more moderate, only that ice insulates water that is below it which is not where the black-throated loon lives.

These minerals incorporate water into their crystal structures (known as water of crystallisation), helping retain water in the Earth's crust before the appearance of life; Choice C is correct.\nHigh heat capacity refers to water’s ability to store heat without large temperature changes, which helps to regulate Earth’s climate, but doesn’t explain why water is retained on Earth; Choice A is incorrect. \nWater is described as a universal solvent as it can dissolve a wide range of substances; however, while water is required for condensation reactions, the process of condensation does not trap water in a manner that would keep it on Earth. Also, biological polymers did not exist until after life emerged. Choice B is incorrect. \nIf water had entered the mantle, the heat there would cause it to evaporate instantly, and therefore, water would not be retained on Earth. Water's ability to sink into the mantle would be due to rock porosity and cracks, not its density; Choice D  is incorrect.",

During both replication and transcription, nucleotides are aligned along the DNA template strand according to base-pairing rules. Hydrogen bonds form between the nitrogenous bases of the template DNA strand and the incoming deoxyribonucleotides (during replication) or ribonucleotides (in transcription).\nThe genetic code being universal means that the same codons code for the same amino acids in all organisms. However, this relates to protein synthesis, not to how DNA acts as a template for replication or transcription; Choice A is incorrect.\nChoice C is incorrect because replication and transcription can’t occur on opposite strands simultaneously. \nChoice D is incorrect because while the sugar-phosphate backbone is a feature of both DNA and RNA strands that provides structural stability, it does not explain how DNA can interact with both DNA and RNA nucleotides.',

The fatty acid tails are hydrophobic, not hydrophilic (Choices A and C), and they align in the centre of the bilayer to minimise exposure to water.\nAdditionally, vesicles are not induced to form in this context (Choices C and D) since the amphipathic nature of phospholipids leads to their self-assembly into bilayers, making external input or induction unnecessary.',

By correctly positioning RuBP and carbon dioxide, the active site lowers the activation energy required for the reaction ($\\checkmark$). This facilitates the formation of an unstable 6-carbon intermediate, which rapidly splits into two molecules of glycerate-3-phosphate ($\\checkmark$).\n  However, rubisco can bind to oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, resulting in photorespiration, which wastes energy and reduces photosynthetic efficiency ($\\checkmark$).

The hydrophobic tails orient away from water, while the hydrophilic heads interact with water, leading to the formation of stable structures ($\\checkmark$).  In aqueous conditions, fatty acids can spontaneously form bilayers ($\\checkmark$), which can then close into spherical vesicles, creating a compartment that minimises hydrophobic interactions ($\\checkmark$).\n  These vesicles played a crucial role in protocell development by providing compartmentalisation, allowing for the concentration of reactants and the formation of early metabolic pathways ($\\checkmark$). The selective permeability of vesicle membranes enabled the controlled exchange of nutrients and waste, an essential step for cellular evolution ($\\checkmark$). Additionally, vesicles had the ability to grow and divide, a process resembling primitive cell division, which was crucial for the emergence of life ($\\checkmark$). The encapsulation of RNA within vesicles would have given protocells an evolutionary advantage by protecting genetic material from degradation, supporting the RNA world hypothesis ($\\checkmark$).\n\n\nA quality mark is awarded if each part of the question (a, b, c) is answered to earn at least half of the points available, answers do not require re-reading to be understood, and there are almost no errors and little irrelevant information. <span class="marks">[1]</span>\n',

    markScheme:
      'C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nPalisade mesophyll cells are cells in the leaves of plants that produce carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Since photosynthesis takes place within chloroplasts, these cells contain a high density of chloroplasts They also contain a large central vacuole, which occupies the space at the center of the cell and helps maintain the turgor pressure in the cell. The position of the central vacuole ensures the chloroplasts will be pushed near the edges of the cell, where they can receive light. Additionally, the vacuole acts as a storage reservoir for water and other nutrients needed for photosynthesis.\nChoice A and Choice D are incorrect because mitochondria are the site of aerobic respiration, during which carbohydrates are broken down to produce ATP. Choice D is also incorrect as the Golgi apparatus packages proteins, not carbohydrates, for export, so Choice B  is also incorrect.',

Samples are rapidly frozen to preserve their natural state before an electron beam is passed through, allowing the structure of individual molecules to be studied.\nChoice A is incorrect because freeze-fracture electron microscopy is primarily used to study cellular structures, such as the internal arrangement of membranes. While it involves rapid freezing and can produce 3D images, it does not resolve molecular or atomic details of protein structures.\nChoice B is incorrect because fluorescent staining is used in light microscopy to identify specific molecules, such as proteins, in cells. Fluorescent dyes or antibodies emit specific wavelengths of light, highlighting target molecules, but they do not provide detailed structural information about proteins.\nChoice D is incorrect because immunofluorescence identifies specific proteins in cells or tissues using fluorescently tagged antibodies.

Therefore, Choice D is correct.\nThe organism is not taking in or making any substance for energy and growth, so Choice A is incorrect.\nExcess water may be considered a waste product. However, the primary purpose of the pump is to regulate osmolarity and prevent lysis. Waste products typically refer to metabolic wastes like carbon dioxide or nitrogenous compounds. Therefore, Choice B is incorrect.\nThe active pumping out of water is the organism's way of maintaining internal conditions rather than just a direct response to the stimulus, and so Choice C is incorrect.",

Prokaryotic cells are often called more simple than eukaryotic cells, but it is important to distinguish between structure and function ($\\checkmark$). Prokaryotic cells may appear simple, but they still carry out all of the functions of life ($\\checkmark$) and have some that are unique to prokaryotes. Although prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles ($\\checkmark$), they still have complex metabolic pathways like cellular respiration and even pathways eukaryotes do not have, like chemosynthesis ($\\checkmark$). Prokaryotes can communicate with each other via cell signalling pathways like quorum sensing ($\\checkmark$) and also have highly specialised structures such as flagellae for motility ($\\checkmark$).

Genetic recombination occurs when many strains of the virus infect the same host, and a new combination of genetic material is observed, which leads to changes in the virus (evolution) over time (Choice A).   Mutations occur rapidly in HIV because it is a single-stranded RNA virus and lacks a mechanism to proofread the genome. The introduction of this variation leads to evolution (Choice B). The genome of humans and the HIV host population, has high genetic diversity. Such diversity in the genome may provide a selective advantage for some HIV strains (Choice D).',

The longer two species have been separated from their common ancestor, the more mutations will have accumulated in their genomes. Therefore, species that are closely related have fewer accumulated mutations and more similar base sequences (Choice B).\nChoice A is incorrect because genome size is not necessarily proportional to the size of the species. The genome size can vary significantly even among organisms of similar size, and organisms with similar-sized genomes, such as the horse and mouse vary greatly in size. Choice C is incorrect because it is possible to have a larger genome size with a comparable, or even smaller, number of genes, depending on the amount of non-coding DNA and repetitive sequences present in the genome. Humans have a larger genome but a similar number of genes to the chimpanzee, mouse and horse.

This can be obtained by doubling the haploid number in the table and recognising that an odd number of diploid chromosomes cannot be evenly distributed to form gametes.\nStatement II is false because the number of chromosomes an organism has is not an accurate reflection of its genome size. Oryza sativa, for example, has a much larger genome than any of the other species in the table despite having fewer chromosomes. Statement III is false because although humans are closely related to chimpanzees, this cannot be concluded from the data in the table alone. Stipa spartea (porcupine grass), for example, has the same number of chromosomes as humans but is not closely related. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they contain one or more false statements.',

This means two populations might look different but still interbreed, or might appear similar but already be reproductively isolated. Because divergence doesn’t follow a fixed pattern, deciding when to define them as separate species becomes subjective.\nStatement II is true because Populations might develop noticeable differences in traits (such as colouration or mating calls), but still produce fertile offspring when they interbreed. According to the biological species concept, they’re technically the same species, but these differences can confuse classification.\nStatement III is false because often, the opposite is true. Genetic differences (mutations, allele frequency changes) may accumulate before any visible morphological change occurs. For example, two populations may look identical but carry distinct genetic markers and be reproductively isolated.\nSaying morphological change “always” comes first is incorrect and overly simplistic.\nChoice A is correct because it includes only the two true Statements I and II.\nChoices B, C and D are incorrect as they include the false Statement III.',

      'B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nSexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes from two individuals, resulting in offspring with a combination of genetic material. This process increases genetic variation, which is essential for evolution and natural selection. Choice B is the correct answer.\nPolyploidy occurs when an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes (e.g., triploid 3n, tetraploid 4n). The definition given in the table describes diploidy (2n), which is the standard chromosome number in most sexually reproducing organisms; Choice A incorrect.\nInterbreeding between different species can sometimes produce infertile offspring, such as a horse × donkey = mule. This is an example of reproductive isolation because the hybrid offspring is sterile, preventing gene flow between the two species. However, because horses and donkeys are already separate species, this does not result in speciation—it simply reinforces their reproductive barrier. For reproductive isolation to lead to speciation, it must occur within a single species, preventing interbreeding between different populations.  Choice C is incorrect.\nMutations are random changes in DNA sequences, not in the amino acid sequence; Choice D is incorrect.',

Its sequence differs enough between species to allow clear differentiation, yet it remains consistent within individuals of the same species. This makes it highly effective for DNA barcoding.\nChoice A is incorrect: If the cytochrome oxidase I gene were too highly conserved (i.e., nearly identical across species), it wouldn’t provide enough variation to distinguish one species from another.\nChoice C is incorrect. The cytochrome oxidase I gene is not exclusive to animals; it is found in the mitochondria of many eukaryotes. Its utility for animal barcoding comes from its pattern of variability, not its exclusivity.\nChoice D is incorrect. The cytochrome oxidase I gene is mitochondrial, not nuclear, and its evolutionary rate is moderate rather than extremely rapid.

    markScheme:
      'C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nMorphological traits, or structures, are useful for creating cladograms. However, cladograms created by comparing such traits may be inaccurate because distantly related organisms can have structures that appear similar but have different genetic bases. The appearance of similar structures with a different evolutionary basis is not evidence of relatedness, but rather is evidence of convergent evolution. So, one reason the cladogram based on the DNA sequences is more reliable than the cladogram based on structures is that similar structures can be coded for by different genes in genetically distant organisms.\nChoice A is incorrect because structures are inherited when species diverge, and the inheritance of structures is beneficial for constructing cladograms.  This is because shared structures are sometimes, but not always, evidence of genetic relatedness.\nChoice B is incorrect because DNA does change over time. Scientists look at sequences of changes in DNA to determine evolutionary relatedness.\nChoice D is incorrect because different structures are generally coded for by different DNA sequences.',

Sympatric speciation is the evolution of a new species from an existing one without geographical isolation (sympatric actually means ‘same geographical area’).

For example, some segments of a population may respond to a particular mating call or mating behaviour not expressed by another segment of the population.\nGeographic isolation (Choice B) occurs when populations are prevented from interbreeding because they are in different physical locations. In this question they are in the same location, therefore this is incorrect. Stabilising selection (Choice C) is a type of natural selection that promotes an intermediate phenotype, so extremes are reduced, and it does not result in speciation. Directional selection (Choice D) is a type of natural selection that promotes an extreme phenotype, but the selection is in one direction so it does not divide the population and so does not lead to speciation. Only if selection occurs in both directions (divergent selection) does it tend to lead to speciation.',

This indicates less time for mutations to accumulate, meaning humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor more recently than humans and mice.\nChoice B is incorrect because although the cytochrome c percentage similarity is lower in chickens (75%) than in mice (87%), this alone does not confirm that cytochrome c evolved faster in the chicken lineage. To determine evolutionary rates, both sequence similarity and known divergence times are needed.\nChoice C is incorrect because the lowest sequence similarity (50%) between human and zebrafish suggests the longest time since divergence, not the most recent.\nChoice D is incorrect because differences in sequence similarity alone cannot demonstrate variation in molecular clock rates. The molecular clock is a concept based on the idea that mutations accumulate at a relatively constant rate over time in most species. To conclude rate differences, both the time since divergence and the number of accrued changes must both be known.',

      'B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nSexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes from two individuals, resulting in offspring with a combination of genetic material. This process increases genetic variation, which is essential for evolution and natural selection. Choice B is the correct answer.\nPolyploidy occurs when an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes (e.g., triploid 3n, tetraploid 4n). The definition given in the table describes diploidy (2n), which is the standard chromosome number in most sexually reproducing organisms; Choice A incorrect.\nInterbreeding between different species can sometimes produce infertile offspring, such as a horse × donkey = mule. This is an example of reproductive isolation because the hybrid offspring is sterile, preventing gene flow between the two species. However, because horses and donkeys are already separate species, this does not result in speciation—it simply reinforces their reproductive barrier. For reproductive isolation to lead to speciation, it must occur within a single species, preventing interbreeding between different populations.  Choice C is incorrect.\nMutations are random changes in DNA sequences, not in the amino acid sequence; Choice D is incorrect.',

Choice C is, therefore, the correct answer.\nChoice A is incorrect because hybrid vigour is often a direct result of allopolyploidy.

      'B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice B is correct because speciation through polyploidy is common in smartweed; if the resulting chromosome number is odd (here 3n), then the plants will become reproductively isolated from the 2n population, even though they are in the same geographic location. This is, therefore, an example of polyploidy and sympatric speciation.\nChoice A is incorrect because, although bonobos and chimpanzees were geographically isolated from each other (allopatric speciation), there was no increase in the chromosome number during the speciation event.  Choice C is incorrect because the lava fields geographically isolated the tortoises, leading to sub-species forming. This is, therefore, an ongoing allopatric speciation event, not sympatric, and it does not involve polyploidy. The tetraploid frog resulted from a polyploidy speciation event that resulted in reproductive isolation. This did not involve spatial separation, so cannot be regarded as allopatric speciation; therefore, Choice D is also incorrect.',

      "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice B is correct because both Lamarckism and epigenetic inheritance propose that environmental factors can cause inherited changes, while Lamarckism suggested these changes were permanent and led to evolution through traits acquired during an organism's lifetime. Epigenetic changes involve reversible chemical modifications to DNA or histone proteins that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. These epigenetic changes can be passed to offspring, but often only persist for a few generations and typically do not lead to long-term evolutionary change.\nChoice A is incorrect because neither Lamarckism nor epigenetic inheritance involves changes to the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetics modifies gene expression through chemical tags, while Lamarckism assumed physical or behavioural changes were inherited.\nChoice C is incorrect because only Lamarckism proposed that the use or disuse of traits directly causes evolutionary change. Epigenetic inheritance does not involve the use or disuse of structures but rather chemical changes to gene regulation influenced by environmental factors. Furthermore, epigenetics does not lead to evolution.\nChoice D is incorrect because epigenetic inheritance does not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself and therefore does not cause long-term evolutionary change.",

Nature reserves increase the chances of successful re-introduction, although many other measures would have to be taken to ensure success. \nChoice A is incorrect because building more captive breeding areas will not increase the chances of being able to reintroduce species back into the wild. \nChoice B is incorrect because, whilst artificial selection would allow desirable traits to be selected for in captivity, this would not necessarily guarantee that species would thrive or even survive in a wild habitat again. Artificial selection would also take a long time (measured in years and decades for some species in particular), as successive generations are bred. \nChoice C is incorrect because having more animals in captivity and plants in botanical gardens would do little to increase the chances of those species being successfully reintroduced to the wild. A large captive population serves no natural purpose to conservation unless a species is released into the wild at some stage.

Choice B is correct.\n\nChoice A is incorrect, as introducing an invasive species usually reduces biodiversity. There are many reasons for this, including competition with native species, predation, herbivory, habitat alteration and the introduction of disease. Choice C is incorrect as although new plants may encourage new insects and plants to immigrate into an area, this would increase biodiversity, not decrease it.  Choice D is incorrect because although invasive species can bring new pests, these pests often reduce biodiversity by decimating native populations.',

Additionally, the EDGE of Existence program only prioritises species on the endangered and vulnerable IUCN lists, which are, therefore, in danger of extinction.\nChoice B is incorrect because the EDGE of Existence program does not use vulnerable ecosystems as a criterion. It focuses solely on species that are evolutionarily distinct and threatened with extinction.\nChoice C is incorrect because while keystone species play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem structure and function, they are not necessarily evolutionarily distinct. The EDGE programme does not prioritise species based on their ecological role.\nChoice D is incorrect because neither keystone species nor vulnerable ecosystems are criteria for the EDGE of Existence program.',
