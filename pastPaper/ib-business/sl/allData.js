      'Ben’s Fika is a newly established Swedish coffee shop founded by 26-year-old entrepreneur, Ben Grahamson. Inspired by Sweden’s traditional coffee culture known as “ fika,” a social coffee break with pastries, Ben saw an opportunity to create a cozy, community focused space in central Stockholm.\nThe business sources local organic ingredients and specializes in traditional Swedish pastries, such as cinnamon buns and cardamom rolls. Initially, Ben operates as a sole trader and hires two part-time baristas. One of his staff members frequently proposes creative new pastry recipes and unique coffee blends to enhance the menu and customer experience. He plans to expand Ben’s Fika into a small chain within the next five years.\nBen faces challenges such as competition from large coffee chains, high rental costs in Stockholm, and the need to build brand loyalty from scratch. However, he sees opportunities in Sweden’s growing demand for artisanal and sustainable products and the increasing popularity of locally owned cafés.\n\n- State two industries that operate in the tertiary sector. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Distinguish one difference between an entrepreneur, like Ben, and an\nintrapreneur, using the context of Ben’s Fika. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain the sector in which Ben’s Fika operates. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Outline one characteristic of Ben that shows he is an entrepreneur. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain one challenge and one opportunity that Ben may face when starting up Ben’s Fika. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class="marks">[Maximum 12]</span>\n',

No application needed.\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One key difference between an entrepreneur and an intrapreneur is that an entrepreneur, like Ben at Ben’s Fika, starts and owns the business, taking on financial risks and making major decisions independently. In contrast, an intrapreneur works within an existing organization and innovates by suggesting new ideas or products; for example, Ben’s staff member who frequently proposes creative new recipes does so as an employee, using the business’s resources without bearing the risks of ownership.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] if the candidate describes one clear difference between an entrepreneur and intrapreneur.\n- Award [1] for the difference being applied in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n\n\n\n- Additional information:\n- Key features of being an entrepreneur:\n- \n  - Entrepreneurs are individuals who take calculated risks and initiative in the start-up of a new business or project.\n\n- \n  - They manage, organize and plan resources needed for business activity.\n\n- \n  - They take the financial risk and exploit business opportunities in return for profit.\n\n- \n  - They often spot an opportunity to improve/change something in the business world.\n\n\n\n\n- Key features of being an intrapreneur:\n- \n  - Intrapreneurship concerns someone employed by a business to develop new ideas.\n\n- \n  - Intrapreneurs use entrepreneurial skills to innovate and drive positive change for a company, rather than starting a separate business.\nHowever, they usually do not take any personal financial risk.\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- Ben’s Fika operates in the tertiary sector, as it provides a service, selling coffee and pastries to customers, rather than producing raw materials or manufacturing goods.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1]  for identifying the sector correctly.\n- Award [1] for justification in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- Key features of the tertiary sector:\n- \n  - Businesses provide a service to customers, i.e. selling the finished products.\n\n- \n  - Examples of businesses in the tertiary sector include: coffee shops (retail industry), hotels and restaurants (hospitality industry), airlines and railways (transportation industry), banks (finance industry).\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- Ben is innovative because he identified an opportunity to bring traditional Swedish fika culture to a business setting by opening a café that focuses on community and local traditions.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1]  for identifying a characteristic of an entrepreneur.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- Key features of an entrepreneur include:\n- \n  - Innovative\n\n- \n  - Risk-taker\n\n- \n  - Visionary\n\n- \n  - Organized\n\n- \n  - Motivated\n\n- \n  - Resilient\n\n- \n  - Confident\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One challenge a new business faces as it tries to establish itself is intense existing competition. Ben's Fika must compete with large, established coffee chains in Stockholm. These chains have strong brand loyalty, large marketing budgets, and economies of scale, making it difficult for Ben's Fika to attract customers and cover high rental costs in a prime location.\n- One opportunity is a favourable external trend that could help the new business succeed, like changes in consumer preferences or gaps in the market. Ben can tap into Sweden's growing demand for artisanal, sustainable products and the popularity of locally owned cafés. By sourcing organic ingredients and focusing on traditional Swedish pastries, Ben's Fika can attract customers who prefer authentic, high-quality experiences over generic chain cafés.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1]  for identifying identifying a relevant challenge.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n- Award [1]  for identifying identifying a relevant opportunity.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n\n\n\n- Additional information:\n- Challenges of starting a business:\n- \n  - Lack of finance: Difficulty securing sufficient capital or investment.\n\n- \n  - Cash flow problems: Irregular revenue makes it hard to cover operational costs.\n\n- \n  - Marketing challenges: Low brand recognition and limited promotional budgets.\n\n- \n  - Legal and administrative barriers: Complex regulations and paperwork can slow down operations.\n\n\n\n\n- Opportunities of starting a business:\n- \n  - Identifying a market gap: Meeting unmet customer needs with a unique product or service.\n\n- \n  - Innovation and creativity: Introducing new ideas, products, or business models to gain a competitive edge.\n\n- \n  - Flexibility and autonomy: Gaining independence by being your own boss and setting your own direction.\n\n- \n  - Potential for high earnings: Greater profit potential compared to being an employee, especially if the business scales.\n\n",

      "Four functional areas or departments in a business are Human Resource Management, Finance and Accounts, Marketing and Operations Management. For an organisation to be successful, each has to perform its role efficiently.\n\n- Human Resource Management is vital in procuring and managing the organisation's employees.\n- Finance and Accounts manage the organisation's money and ensure compliance with tax laws.\n- Marketing identifies customers' needs.\n- Operations Management is responsible for efficiently carrying out the organisation's core business.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nHuman Resource Management is vital in procuring and managing the employee bank. An efficient workforce is indispensable to a business if it is to be a financially viable enterprise. The human resource management team ensures a well-trained, motivated workforce. They plan ahead in keeping with the organisation's projected growth, are responsible for creating an efficient structure with decisive leadership and deal with industrial-employee relationships. Whether the business is a production or service, an efficient employee base is its most valuable asset, and this asset is managed by the human resource department.\nFinance and Accounts manage the organisation's money and ensure compliance with tax laws. Part of their function is ensuring sufficient cash flow without excess unused funds. This department keeps shareholders and senior management informed of the organisation's financial position.\nFinance and accounts are crucial in providing financial information and analysis to support decision-making. The department helps in efficient resource allocation and budgeting and safeguards the organisation's assets. Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is another important function.\nMarketing is a vital function. This department identifies customers' needs through market research and knowledge of the specific industry. The organisation then designs products to meet customer expectations, generating a higher market acceptance and sales volume. Every business needs sufficient sales of products or services to survive and be profitable.\nThe Operations Management department is responsible for efficiently carrying out the organisation's core business, whether it is production, retail or service. A well-managed production facility will produce quality goods on time, an enjoyable retail experience will gain a large customer base and grow, and a well-run service industry like a hotel or travel agency will gain a favourable reputation and have repeat customers. Efficient management of operations in any business creates goodwill for the organisation and ensures profitability and growth.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identification of each area.\n2 marks for explaining each area in detail.\nTotal - 4 marks",

These can include labour, raw materials, technology and capital. Efficient sourcing of resources is vital to the successful and profitable production of goods or services.\nOutputs are the goods or services a business generates to meet customers' needs or wants, using inputs and processing them to add value. The product or service can be for individual customers or other businesses, such as transportation, insurance, and information technology services.\nThe term product can refer to both goods or services. Goods, like cars, smartphones, and chocolates, are physical products that can be seen and touched. Services involve benefits or activities offered to customers without a physical product. These are intangible, like cloud computing services, education, or healthcare, and cannot be physically touched.\nAn entrepreneur is an individual who takes the initiative to plan, set up and operate a business, taking on the risks and responsibilities associated with business ownership. Successful entrepreneurs are creative, innovative and passionate about their chosen business area.\nValue addition is the process of enhancing the value of a product or service. Value addition for creating a positive difference between the production and selling costs of a product or service is the purpose and nature of a business. Value addition improves the quality, features, and desirability, making a product more attractive to customers and, therefore, able to command a higher price.\nIndividuals' needs are basic necessities for survival, such as food, shelter and clothing. These are things humans cannot do without.\nWants are people's desires beyond their basic needs and are things they want to own or experience. Wants are shaped by individual tastes and preferences and can include things like a larger home, expensive cars, exotic holidays, jewellery and luxury clothing.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying two key terms related to the concept of business (1 mark for each term).\n2 marks for explaining the terms in detail (1 mark for each detailed explanation).\nTotal - 4 marks",

      'FairHarvest Cooperative is a worker cooperative based in the countryside of Cornwall, UK. The cooperative was formed by a group of local farmers and food producers who wanted to sell their products directly to consumers, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair wages for everyone involved.\nCurrently, FairHarvest’s primary customers are local grocery stores, which stock their organic fruits and vegetables as part of their commitment to offering locally sourced goods. In addition to grocery stores, FairHarvest also sells products through a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program, local farmers\' markets, and to nearby restaurants.\nFigure 1: Projected Sales Growth of Organic Products 2025-2030\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/c844a737-4b46-4c1d-8183-dfc68c67d122/images/473b7de3-b9d5-4927-b25f-b01252fb14f1/Screenshot%202025-07-21%20at%2012.08.13.JPEG)\n\n\nAs a cooperative, the members of FairHarvest benefit from shared profits, and the earnings are reinvested into the cooperative to fund new equipment, expand their farm operations, and support local community initiatives.

While it allows all members to have an equal vote, this can slow down decision-making, especially when there is a conflict between younger and older members regarding the adoption of modern farming methods. Younger members may want to invest in new technology, but older members are resistant to change, which could create tension and delay important decisions for the cooperative’s future.\n- Another challenge is competition from larger agricultural companies that benefit from economies of scale. Since FairHarvest is a smaller cooperative, they may struggle to match the prices and production output of larger, non-organic farming companies. This could limit their market share and impact profitability, especially if they continue to use more traditional farming methods that are less cost-efficient.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for each challenge identified, up to a maximum of [2].\n- Award [1] for each explanation applied to the case to a maximum of [2].\n- Award a maximum of [4].\n",

      'PureBliss began as a sole trader business, specialising in handcrafted soaps made in a small, local shop. The owner, Jawaher, is personally involved in every aspect of the business and had daily contact with customers, offering a warm, personalized experience. She was known for being quick to respond to customer feedback, often incorporating popular requests into the development of new soap varieties. This responsiveness helped PureBliss build a loyal local customer base.\nAs PureBliss continues to grow in popularity, Jawaher is finding it increasingly difficult to manage the workload on her own. With rising demand and plans to expand the product range, she recognises the need for additional capital to support the next phase of growth. However, Jawaher is highly protective of the creative process and wants to ensure the brand’s unique identity remains intact.\nFor this reason, she is considering taking on a silent partner. Jawaher has done her research on types of legal business structures, and believes this is the most suitable for her to grow her business.\n\n- Define the term silent partner. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain two advantages for Jawaher of setting up PureBliss as a sole trader. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n- Explain two disadvantages for Jawaher of taking on a silent partner. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class="marks">[Maximum 10]</span>\n',

She could decide on product designs, pricing, suppliers, and marketing without needing approval from partners or shareholders. This allowed her to quickly respond to customer feedback and introduce new soap varieties based on popular demand, helping the business grow and build customer loyalty.\n- Another major advantage is that Jawaher was entitled to keep all the profits the business made. Since there were no other owners at the beginning, she could reinvest earnings directly into PureBliss to expand the product range or improve the shop, supporting the growth of the business from a small local venture to a thriving operation.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Mark as 2 + 2\n- Award [1] for each advantage identified and an additional [1] for application to the case study.\n- Award a maximum of [4].\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- A drawback relevant to Jawaher is that the silent partner would not be involved in the day-to-day running of the business. While this means Jawaher retains creative control, it also means she would still be responsible for managing the growing workload on her own. If Jawaher's aim is to grow the business, this is likely to lead to increased stress and operational challenges.\n- A second drawback is that Jawaher would have to share the business profits with the sleeping partner. Even though the partner is not involved in managing the business, they are still entitled to a portion of the earnings, which reduces Jawaher’s overall financial return from the success she built.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Mark as 2 + 2\n- Award [1] for each drawback identified and an additional [1] for application to the case study.\n- Award a maximum of [4].\n",

      'GreenTech Innovations was originally a privately held company (LTD) focused on designing and manufacturing solar panels and renewable energy technologies. The company was founded with an environmentally-focused mission, committed to using sustainable materials and reducing carbon emissions. Initially, GreenTech raised capital through private investment and grants to support its operations.\nHowever, as the company expanded and sought additional funding to scale operations, GreenTech Innovations transitioned into a Publicly Held Company (PLC). The decision to become a  PLC was driven by the need to raise significant capital for research and development, and to expand production capacity.\nSince becoming a PLC, GreenTech Innovations has faced increasing pressure from investors to improve profitability and deliver short-term returns. Investors are demanding higher profits and faster growth, which has led to a shift in strategy.

Privately held companies have limited sources of funds.\n- Regulatory requirements - Publicly owned companies are subject to elaborate and stringent regulatory requirements. Privately held companies have to comply with fewer regulations.\n- Shareholder control - Publicly held companies experience limited influence by shareholders. Shareholders and owners of privately held companies have more control over decisions and management.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nA publicly held (or owned) company is a limited liability company listed on the stock exchange where shareholders can buy and sell shares. The ownership is dispersed among numerous shareholders.\nA privately held company is owned by shareholders with limited liability, but its shares cannot be bought or sold by the general public on the stock exchange. The ownership is confined to a smaller number of founders and investors. Shareholders can buy or sell shares only with the board of directors' approval.\nPublicly held companies can raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) when a publicly held company first sells all or part of its shares to external investors. The company can sell shares to the public and generate finance for expansion or acquisitions.\nPrivately held companies have more limited options for raising capital. Their usual sources are loans from banks or financial institutions, private investments or retained earnings.\nPublicly held companies are subject to stringent regulatory requirements imposed by government authorities, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) in Europe. Regulators strictly enforce compliance with corporate governing standards, accurate financial reporting and disclosure obligations.\nPrivately held companies face relatively fewer regulatory obligations. Their financial disclosures need not be as detailed as those of a publicly held company, and they have more flexibility in their corporate governance.\nA characteristic of publicly held companies is a separation between the numerous owners and those who manage and run the company. Shareholders have voting rights, often in proportion to the size of their shareholding. The functionaries are elected and appointed through voting. In reality, shareholders have limited influence over operations.\nPrivately held companies have a more direct link between shareholders and control of the company. The owners are often directly involved in the management or have control over strategic decisions and governance.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

Privately owned companies would not have that advantage and would struggle to operate profitably.\nPublic sector companies play a vital role in safeguarding and promoting strategic national interests through operating companies involved in defence-related production, energy, communications and infrastructure development. The government can ensure national security and sovereignty by controlling essential resources and infrastructure. Governments must closely monitor and manage critical production facilities such as weapons and nuclear power for safety.\nPublic sector companies have the advantage of financial stability through government backing. They can be involved in projects and services with very long gestation periods. These projects would not be financially attractive to private enterprises. Governments use wholly owned and controlled public sector companies, like banks and financial institutions, to interfere with and stabilise or give direction to the economic environment in the country.\nGovernments, through private sector companies, are the largest employers in any country. Many teachers and medical professionals in any country work for government-owned institutions, as do employees in administrative, policing and defence forces. Public sector companies offer job security with a stable environment and significantly contribute to reducing unemployment.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each advantage of public sector companies.\n2 marks for explaining each advantage of public sector companies.\nTotal - 4 marks',

      'Second Chance Coffee is a for-profit social enterprise set up by entrepreneur Lewis Grant in Glasgow. The business operates a stylish coffee shop that serves ethically sourced coffee, baked goods, and light meals. What sets Second Chance Coffee apart is its mission: all its employees are either homeless or ex-prisoners, many of whom struggled to find stable employment.\nLewis, a former social worker, launched the business to provide a supportive environment and help individuals reintegrate into society through employment, training, and mentorship. Although the coffee shop aims to make a profit, its social mission is at the heart of every decision. Lewis reinvests a portion of the profits into staff development and welfare programs.\nDespite a growing customer base, the business faces high training and support costs, and sometimes deals with challenges related to team management and social stigma. However, Lewis believes that combining social purpose with a strong brand is the key to long-term success.\n\n- Define the term social enterprise. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- With reference to Second Chance Coffee, explain one feature of for-profit social enterprises. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain one reason why Lewis might have chosen to set up Second Chance Coffee as a for-profit social enterprise. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain two challenges Second Chance Coffee may face as a for-profit social enterprise. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class="marks">[Maximum 10]</span>\n',

Profits are often reinvested into the community or cause rather than distributed to owners.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.\n- Award [1] for a definition that shows partial understanding.\n- Award [2] for a definition that shows understanding similar to the answer above.\n- No application is required.\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- A for-profit social enterprise aims to earn profit while achieving social goals. Second Chance Coffee generates income by selling coffee and food, but also helps homeless individuals and ex-prisoners by employing and training them.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for identifying a relevant feature of a for-profit social enterprise.\n- Award [1] for applying the feature to Second Chance Coffee.\n- Candidates are not expected to word their responses exactly as above.\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- According to triple bottom line theory (Elkington), businesses can aim to balance profit, people, and the planet rather than focusing solely on financial returns. By choosing to set up Second Chance Coffee as a for-profit social enterprise, Lewis could apply this approach by generating income (profit) while supporting homeless people and ex-prisoners into employment (people). This allowed him to create long-term social impact through a financially sustainable model, rather than relying only on donations or government funding.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for identifying a reason.\n- Award [1] for applying it to the case (e.g. Lewis’s background, employment goals).\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One challenge is the high cost of training and supporting staff who may have little or no previous work experience. Since all employees at Second Chance Coffee are homeless or ex-prisoners, Lewis must invest extra time and money into onboarding, skills development, and mentoring, which increases operational costs and affects short-term profitability.\n- A second challenge is social stigma, where businesses must gain legitimacy in society. Some customers or potential investors may be hesitant to support a business staffed by individuals with criminal records, which could limit market growth or funding opportunities despite the company’s strong ethical values.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Mark as 2+2\n- Award [1] for each challenge identified up to a maximum of [2].\n- Award [1] for each challenge applied to the case up to a maximum of [2].\n- Answers must refer to Second Chance Coffee’s context (e.g. staff background, social mission).\n',

      'Cooperativa Esperanza is an agricultural cooperative made up of small-scale farmers in Guatemala. By working together, these farmers pool their resources to purchase supplies in bulk, share machinery, and access larger markets to better compete with bigger agricultural businesses.\nHowever, the cooperative faces several challenges. There are language and cultural barriers between members, which sometimes lead to miscommunication and difficulties in decision-making. Additionally, while the cooperative recognises the need to invest in more modern machinery to improve productivity, obtaining additional funding has proven difficult due to limited access to finance and for rural businesses.\nIn the local area, it is common for children not to finish primary education, as many end up working on farmland alongside their parents to support the family’s income. A local non-governmental organization  (NGO) has approached Cooperativa Esperanza with an offer to provide training and access to more advanced farming methods and technology. The aim is to help improve agricultural productivity so that families rely less on child labour and children are given the opportunity to complete their schooling.\n\n- State two features of a cooperative. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Cooperativa Esperanza of being a cooperative. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n- With reference to Cooperativa Esperanza, explain two objectives of NGOs. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class="marks">[Maximum 10]</span>\n',

For example, they can purchase supplies in bulk, share machinery, and work together to access larger markets, which helps them compete more effectively with bigger agricultural businesses.\n- One disadvantage is that decision-making can be slow and complicated, especially when there are differences between members, such as language barriers, cultural differences, or conflicting priorities between older and younger farmers. This can make it harder to agree on important decisions, such as whether to accept a takeover offer or how to invest in new machinery.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Mark as 2+2\n- Award [1] for each advantage/disadvantage identified and an additional  [1] for application to Cooperativa Esperanza.\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One objective of NGOs is to promote social development and protect vulnerable groups. In the case of Cooperativa Esperanza, the NGO’s aim is to reduce the number of children who leave school early to work on farms. By supporting the cooperative with training and access to advanced farming methods, the NGO helps reduce the need for child labour so that children can complete their education, contributing to the long-term social and economic development of the community.\n- Another objective of NGOs is to enhance economic sustainability for disadvantaged communities. For Cooperativa Esperanza, the NGO aims to improve farming productivity through modern farming techniques and technology. This allows families to earn more income from their land without relying on outdated, labour-intensive methods, helping to improve living standards and ensure long-term economic resilience for the cooperative’s members.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Mark as 2+2\n- Award [1] for each objective identified and an additional [1] for application to Cooperativa Esperanza.\n',

    markScheme:
      "Key feature of Publicly Held Company:\n\n- Ownership: A wide range of individual and institutional investors own publicly traded corporation shares. These investors buy the company's stock through open stock markets.\n- Disclosure Requirements: Publicly held companies must comply with several regulatory and reporting requirements, including the regulation that financial statements and public disclosures be filed regularly.\n- Access to Capital: Public-held companies can readily obtain capital by offering more shares of their stock for sale to the general public, which can then be exchanged on stock markets.\n- Ownership Liquidity: Investors benefit from the ease with which shareholders of publicly held companies can purchase and sell their shares on the open market.\n\nKey feature of Private Held Company:\n\n- Ownership: The shares of privately held companies are not listed on a public exchange and are usually owned by a smaller group of investors, such as the founders, family and friends.\n- Disclosure Requirements: Since privately held businesses are exempt from the duty to disclose their financial information to the public, they are subject to less regulatory reporting requirements than publicly held companies.\n- Access to money: Because privately held companies rely on loans, retained earnings, or private investments for finance, their access to money may be more constrained.\n- Control and Decision-Making: Because privately held companies have fewer shareholders and are subject to less public scrutiny, their owners typically have more control over the day-to-day operations and decision-making of the business.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nDespite their apparent similarities, publicly traded and privately held companies differ significantly in several crucial areas. Shares of publicly held companies are owned by a wide range of individuals, including large and regular investors who trade their shares on the stock exchange. They must share financial reports and information with the public, which can be a lot of work, to keep everyone informed about how they're doing. This implies they have many owners who can purchase or sell their shares fast, but it also makes it easier for them to make money by selling additional shares to the general public.\nOn the other hand, the number of owners in privately held companies is lower. Since they don't offer shares to the general public, the company is governed by a small group of friends or family. They enjoy more privacy because they are not required to disclose their financial information to the public as often. However, because individuals can't just sell stock market shares when they need money, finding it can be more difficult. Owners typically have greater authority over the business, and selling or buying an ownership stake is more complex. Consequently, even if both types of businesses operate, their policies and procedures differ.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

Shares are sold to private family and friends. Privately-held companies are incorporated businesses, meaning the owners have a separate legal identity from the business. A broader capital base and various funding choices, such as shareholder investments, loans, venture capital, or joint ventures with other companies, are possible.

      "Advantages of being a partnership:\n\n- Finance: Multiple owners invest in the company with a simple and inexpensive set-up.\n- Specialised partners: Division of labour is possible as partners may specialise in specific company areas, improving productivity and efficiency.\n- Privacy: Partnerships do not publish their financial records.\n\nDisadvantages of being a partnership:\n\n- Continuity: When a partner leaves the partnership or passes away, the partnership needs to be completely set up again; this leads to a lack of continuity.\n- Liability: Partnerships have unlimited liability. Therefore, partners are responsible for the company's debts, even if other partners encounter these.\n- Decision-making: Decisions need to be made by the partners, which leads to a longer time for decisions to be made and agreed upon by all partners.\n\nAdvantage 1:\nOne advantage of being a partnership is the division of labour. Specialised work is possible since partners may focus on specific areas of the company and divide the company's tasks. With each partner focusing on specialised tasks, productivity and efficiency will likely improve, thus increasing profits and motivation.\nAdvantage 2:\nA partnership will benefit from multiple owners investing in the company, leading to an increase in finance to set up and sustain the company. Also, setting up a partnership is simple, fast and inexpensive, an advantage of forming a partnership.\nDisadvantage 1:\nOne disadvantage of being a partnership is having unlimited liability. With unlimited liability, all partners are responsible for the debts and legal issues encountered by the company, even if this is from one partner or if the company encounters a loss at some point. Therefore, partners must respond to the debts, which may affect their personal property if a debt is not paid out.\nDisadvantage 2:\nDisagreements in decision-making are disadvantages in partnerships; all of the members of a partnership need to agree on all decisions made before they are implemented. This will slow down the decision-making process, even if some of those decisions must be made fast, creating a communication problem and affecting the company's efficiency. This could also create a problem if not all partners agree.",

They are more detailed and actionable.\nBelow are some key differences of Aims and Objectives:\nAims\n\n- Aims are usually open-ended and do not have specific details or deadlines attached to them.\n- Aims are not easily measurable since they are broad and qualitative.\n- Aims often have an indefinite or long-term time frame and may not have a fixed deadline.\n- Aims encompass the overall vision and purpose of the business and may involve multiple aspects of the organisation.\n- Aims provide the overarching vision and strategic direction, helping to align the organisation's efforts.\n- An aim for a business might be to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$become a market leader in the industry$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ without specifying how or when.\n- Aims set the overall direction and purpose for the business but, on their own, do not ensure success.\n\nObjectives\n\n- Objectives are highly specific and have clear criteria, such as deadlines, quantities, or percentages.\n- Objectives are measurable because they are defined with specific, quantifiable criteria that allow progress tracking.\n- Objectives have a defined time frame, typically short- to medium-term, and are time-bound.\n- Objectives are more focused and deal with particular aspects or functions of the business.\n- Objectives serve as actionable steps toward realising the aims and are critical for strategic planning and decision-making.\n- Objectives related to the above aim could include $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$increase market share by $10\\%$ within the next two years$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ or $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$launch a new product line by the end of the fiscal year.$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$\n- Objectives are the actionable steps that, when achieved, contribute directly to the business's success by fulfilling the aims.\n\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}$:\nAims and objectives represent two fundamental components in the strategic planning of a business. Aims, the broader and more abstract of the two, serve as the overarching vision and long-term goals of the organisation. They provide a sense of direction and purpose, helping to align the efforts of the business towards a common goal. However, it's essential to recognise that aims lack specificity and measurability. These goals are often open-ended, lacking specific details or deadlines. For instance, an aim for a business might be the ambition to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$become a market leader in the industry.$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ While this is undoubtedly a big aspiration that provides a sense of direction, it does not contain the specific criteria necessary for measurement, nor does it stipulate a deadline for its achievement.\nIn contrast, objectives are the practical, specific, and measurable steps that a business puts in place to realise its aims. Objectives are designed to be actionable and serve as the bridge between the broad aspirations encapsulated in aims and the practical implementation required for success. These objectives are characterised by their high level of specificity and measurability. For example, if the aim is to become a market leader, objectives may include $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$increase market share by 10% within the next two years$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ or $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$launch a new product line by the end of the fiscal year.$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ Objectives are often set with clear criteria, such as deadlines, quantities, or percentages, making it possible to track progress and determine success.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

      'EcoFurniture Co. is a mid-sized furniture company based in Leeds, UK, that specializes in sustainable and eco-friendly furniture. The company was founded by Emma Collins in 2015 with the mission of reducing environmental waste by using 100% recycled materials and sustainable wood sources. The business has grown steadily, focusing on providing stylish, durable furniture made from sustainably sourced materials, aiming to offer an environmentally responsible alternative to traditional furniture manufacturers.\nAs the company looks to expand into new markets and meet the growing demand for eco-friendly products, Emma and her team are developing a set of business objectives to guide their growth. They want to increase their market share in the furniture industry, with a focus on expanding into international markets within the next 5 years.

A mission statement focuses on the execution of purpose.\n- Consistency, change: A vision statement is long-term and enduring. An organisation might adjust its mission statement from time to time.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nA vision statement outlines an organisation's aspirations and long-term goals. It is a reflection of where it would like to position itself in the distant future and a preview of what the company envisions its success should look like. A vision statement gives a general direction to an organisation's intended goal.\nA mission statement is more focused on the present. It is a declaration of the fundamental purpose of an organisation's existence and its core values.\nA vision statement is inspirational and usually abstract. The statement is not about targets that need to be achieved but projects a vision of what can be accomplished. A vision statement inspires and binds the employees, owners and stakeholders together.\nA mission statement is specific and action-oriented. It outlines the principles of the organisation and sets a framework for how managers and employees operate to achieve its goals.\nA vision statement is inspirational and motivates employees and stakeholders by creating an environment of unity and commitment through a shared sense of purpose and direction.\nA mission statement is about the organisation's actions and focuses on execution during daily operations. It outlines the action to achieve its objectives and guides the decision-making process. A mission statement, though qualitative, should be clearly defined and achievable.\nA characteristic of vision statements is that they are stable and relevant in the long term. They can be refined from time to time, but the core message is consistent with the timeless values and goals of the organisation.\nOn the other hand, a mission statement is frequently adjusted to suit changes in the business environment, including market conditions and trends. An organisation's priorities can change over time, and the mission statement needs to be adjusted to remain relevant.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

      "Ethical objectives are organisational goals based on moral guidelines determined by the business and/or society, which direct and determine decision-making.\nAdvantages:\n\n- Improved corporate image\n- Increased customer loyalty\n- Cost cutting\n- Improved staff morale and motivation\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n- Compliance costs\n- Lower profits\n- Stakeholder conflicts\n- The subjective nature of business ethics\n\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}$:\nThe impact of adopting ethical objectives and practices in a business is a complex issue that has both positive and negative consequences. Ethical objectives, defined by an organisation's moral guidelines and societal norms, play a pivotal role in shaping decision-making and can significantly influence the business's performance.\nOne of the key advantages of having ethical objectives is the substantial improvement in the corporate image. When a company adheres to strong ethical principles, it is viewed more favourably by customers, employees, and the public. This positive perception can lead to increased trust, loyalty, and support from customers, resulting in a boost to the brand's reputation. A strong corporate image not only enhances market competitiveness but also paves the way for long-term sustainability. It is also noteworthy that improved corporate image often translates into higher profitability, as ethical businesses are more likely to attract a larger customer base.\nHowever, there are disadvantages as the implementation of ethical standards and practices can come with compliance costs, as businesses must allocate resources for ethical training, monitoring, and ensuring adherence to these standards. These costs can strain a company's financial resources, potentially leading to reduced short-term profits. In addition to compliance costs, adhering to stringent ethical standards may require changes to business processes and operations, which may not always align with short-term profitability objectives. This presents a complex dilemma for businesses as they navigate between the pursuit of ethical goals and the need to remain financially viable.\nIn essence, while ethical objectives can enhance a company's corporate image and long-term sustainability, they may require financial sacrifices and present challenges for businesses in the short term.\nMark Allocation:\n2 Marks: Identification of impacts (e.g., enhanced reputation, customer loyalty, operational challenges, etc.).\n2 Marks: Explanation of how these impacts influence the business (e.g., ethical practices attract socially conscious customers, increase costs, improve employee satisfaction, etc.).\nTotal - 4 marks",

      "Corporate social responsibility, or 'CSR', is a business concept that describes an organisation's commitment to carrying out its business while being mindful of its social and environmental impact. CSR is subjective and based on public opinion, which differs from country to country or from time to time. CSR is considered an indispensable part of efforts to promote an organisation's reputation and make it seem trustworthy and caring of the environment, society and stakeholders.\n\n- Ethical behaviour, stakeholder consideration: A significant feature of CSR is ethical decision-making and considering stakeholders' interests.\n- Environmental Sustainability: CSR involves careful consideration of the environmental impact of the organisation's activities.\n- Social initiatives, philanthropy: Community development and philanthropy are significant features of CSR.\n- Transparency and accountability: CSR promotes transparency, especially when activities involve environmental or social impact.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nEthical decision-making and responsible business practices are the core features of CSR. Organisations commit to ethical behaviour towards all stakeholders and their communities. This commitment includes considering the interest and fair treatment of employees, suppliers and customers.\nAn organisation with the reputation of being considerate has a favourable advantage in the eyes of stakeholders and customers.\nAwareness of environmental damage and the urgency of preventing further deterioration has grown in the past few decades. A feature of CSR is that ecological considerations guide the decision-making process, and due care is taken to ensure business activities do not cause any damage to the environment. Organisations engage in green initiatives to reduce their ecological impact through using renewable energy, recycling, and reducing emissions.\nMany customers prefer patronising organisations known to follow environmentally sustainable practices.\nA key feature of CSR is engaging in local communities and participating in their development. Organisations set aside budgets to support charities and help with social causes. They donate funds and allocate resources to help alleviate social and humanitarian issues.\nPhilanthropy is essential in enhancing an organisation's reputation in the eyes of customers and stakeholders, thus giving it an advantage over competitors.\nCSR confirms an organisation's transparency culture by disclosing information concerning their activities' social and environmental impact. Organisations publish reports disclosing their goals and initiatives in their drive towards sustainability and community development and often monitor compliance and progress in meeting their CSR goals.\nAn organisation known to be transparent and honest in its dealing with environmental and social issues is looked upon favourably and trusted by customers, stakeholders and investors.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each feature.\n2 marks for explaining each feature.\nTotal - 4 marks",

      'Celtic Sounds is a popular Irish music festival held annually in a different town or rural location each year across Ireland. The festival celebrates traditional and contemporary Irish music, attracting thousands of tourists, both domestic and international, who travel to experience the vibrant performances, local culture, and scenic settings.\nThe arrival of the festival often brings significant economic benefits to the host area. Local hotels, restaurants, pubs, and shops typically report a substantial increase in trade during the festival period. Additionally, the event raises the profile of small towns and rural communities, encouraging future tourism.\nHowever, not all local residents and businesses are supportive. The festival often leads to road closures, traffic congestion, and disruptions to everyday business activities.

      "Some reasons for conflict between shareholders and suppliers:\n\n- Profit Maximisation vs Cost Reduction: Shareholders often seek to maximise profits and returns on their investments in the company. On the other hand, suppliers aim to maintain their revenue and profit margins.\n- Payment Terms: Shareholders may prefer longer payment terms to improve the company's cash flow and bottom line, as this delays the outflow of funds. However, suppliers generally prefer shorter payment terms, as it helps them maintain a consistent cash flow.\n- Quality vs Cost: Shareholders may focus on cost control and profitability, often pushing for lower-priced materials or services. Suppliers, on the other hand, may emphasise the importance of maintaining the quality of goods or services provided.\n- Supply Chain Reliability: Shareholders may seek to diversify the supply chain to mitigate risk, potentially by engaging multiple suppliers. Suppliers, however, prefer exclusivity and consistent orders.\n- Contract Negotiations: Shareholders may expect aggressive contract negotiations with suppliers to secure favourable terms for the company. Suppliers may view these negotiations as overly demanding or unfair, potentially harming their relationship with the company and affecting future cooperation.\n- Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals: Shareholders often have a vested interest in the company's stock performance in the short term. This may lead to a focus on immediate cost reduction, which can conflict with a supplier's perspective that prioritises building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}$:\nShareholders often seek to maximise profits and returns on their investments in the company. This objective may lead them to desire cost-cutting measures, which could include pressuring the management to negotiate lower prices with suppliers. On the other hand, suppliers aim to maintain their revenue and profit margins. Thus, when shareholders push for reduced costs, it can put suppliers in a difficult position, as they may need to make concessions that impact their own profitability.\nShareholders like longer payment terms when the company owes money because this means the company can hold onto its cash for a longer period. Holding onto cash can improve the company's financial position and give it more flexibility. When the company has more cash on hand, it appears healthier and more stable.\nOn the other hand, suppliers prefer shorter payment terms when they sell something. They want to get paid quickly because it ensures they have a steady inflow of cash. This consistent cash inflow is crucial for them to manage their own expenses and keep their operations running smoothly.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each reason.\n2 marks for explaining each reason.\nTotal - 4 marks",

      "Stakeholders:\nStakeholders are individuals or groups of individuals who have an interest in the business. They are divided into internal stakeholders and external stakeholders.\nInternal stakeholders include:\n\n- Employees\n- Managers\n- Shareholders or owners\n\nExternal stakeholders include:\n\n- Customers\n- Suppliers\n- Banks\n- Community\n- Government\n- Pressure groups\n- Competitors\n\nShareholders:\nShareholders are those who own shares of a limited liability company, these can be in the form of individuals or may be organisations who have an interest in the company.\nShareholders have two main interests in the company:\n\n- Maximize profits to receive higher dividends\n- Increase the value of the company’s shares\n\nDifferences:\nShareholders are one group of stakeholders of a company, most of the time they are internal stakeholders, with the exception of shareholders who own shares of the company but are not part of the daily operations.\nShareholders are an important group of stakeholders as much of the funding of a company comes from its shareholders and the company focuses much of its efforts in meeting the interests of shareholders; which are to maximize its profits and to increase the value of the company’s shares.\nConflict:\nConflict is likely to arise between shareholders and other groups of stakeholders on certain occasions.\nFor example: an increase in pay for employees, who are internal stakeholders, may not be well accepted by shareholders, as it could decrease the company’s profits and lead to lower returns to shareholders in the form of dividends. From another point of view, an increase in employees' pay could improve employee motivation, and thus increase productivity and efficiency in the company, leading to an increase in profits and as a result an increase in the value of the company’s shares.",

      'GreenTech Innovations is a publicly held company based in London, specializing in the development and manufacturing of solar panels and renewable energy technologies. The company went public five years ago and is now listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nGreenTech Innovations\' mission is to provide innovative, sustainable energy solutions to address the growing need for clean energy, while their vision is to become a global leader in the renewable energy sector.\nSince becoming a PLC, GreenTech has faced increased pressure from investors to improve profitability and deliver short-term returns. Investors are demanding higher profits and faster growth, which has led to a shift in strategy.\nThe company has faced growing tension between its initial mission of promoting green energy and the increasing pressure to invest in fossil fuel technologies. Some shareholders are advocating for the company to diversify its portfolio by investing in oil and gas to generate higher profits, a move that conflicts with GreenTech’s founding environmental goals.\n\n- Define the term stakeholder. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain two stakeholder conflicts that might arise as a result of GreenTech Innovations changing from an LTD to a PLC. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n- Explain two ways the proposed shift in GreenTech Innovations’ strategy could impact its relationship with stakeholders. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class="marks">[Maximum 10]</span>\n',

They can be internal (people who own or work for the business, e.g. managers, employees or shareholders) or external (local community, government or their competition). They are interested in a business's decisions or actions but can not always influence them.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.\n- Award [1] for a vague definition.\n- Award [2] for a complete definition.\n- Definitions do not require application to the stimulus material.\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One conflict that might arise is between investors/shareholders and employees. As GreenTech becomes a PLC, shareholders may push for higher profits and quicker returns, which could lead to cost-cutting measures or a shift towards more profitable sectors, such as fossil fuels. Employees, especially those involved in sustainable energy projects, may feel that such a shift compromises the company’s core values of sustainability, causing dissatisfaction among staff who are passionate about environmental goals.\n- Another conflict could arise between customers and investors/shareholders. Customers who are loyal to GreenTech's environmentally sustainable mission may be disappointed if the company expands into fossil fuel sectors to meet the profit demands of investors. This could lead to a loss of customer loyalty and damage the company's brand reputation, while investors might see this diversification as a necessary step for increasing profitability.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for each stakeholder conflict identified, up to a maximum of [2].\n- Award [1] for each explanation of how the conflict might arise, applied to GreenTech’s situation, to a maximum of [2].\n- Award a maximum of [4].\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- The shift towards fossil fuel investments could negatively impact GreenTech’s relationship with its customers. Customers who have chosen GreenTech for its commitment to sustainability may feel that the company is compromising its ethical values for profit, leading to diminished customer loyalty and possible loss of market share.\n- In contrast, the shift could improve GreenTech’s relationship with investors. The pressure from investors for higher short-term returns might be satisfied if the company diversifies into the fossil fuel sector. This could attract more investment, potentially increasing share prices and returning profits, leading to greater investor satisfaction and confidence in the company’s financial growth.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for identifying each stakeholder group impacted up to a maximum of [2].\n- Award [1] for explaining how the shift would impact the relationship with the stakeholder group up to a maximum of [2].\n- Award a maximum of [4].\n",

Suppliers provide stock of raw materials and component parts, as well as the services of technical support and maintenance.\nInvolvement in the company:\nSuppliers are important to a company for the following reasons:\n\n- Stock is needed for production, a company which establishes a good relationship with its suppliers will improve the time of delivery of stocks and also improve the price which the company is charged for its stock.\n- Credit is also a reason why suppliers are an important external stakeholder to a company, suppliers will at times provide credit to those companies which establish a good relationship with them, thus facilitating a better cash flow position.\n\nCompetitors:\nCompetitors are considered external stakeholders as they are the adversaries of the company. However, at times competitors may also hold shares of a company which they hold an interest in.\nInvolvement in a company:\nCompetitors are involved in a competing company for the following reasons:\n\n- Companies observe and become involved in competing companies to remain competitive in the market in which they operate and be prepared to respond to actions of the competition as fast as possible to avoid losing recognition.\n- To measure their company against the competitors, this is in the form of comparing profits and market share.\n- Competitors also encourage companies to innovate and create new products to stay competitive.\n',

Therefore, they have reasons to be concerned about its performance since they invest in a business with the sole objective of profit-making.\n\n- Dividend Yield: A dividend is the part of a company's annual earnings distributed to its shareholders.\n- Capital Appreciation: Capital appreciation through a positive difference in the share purchase price and the current listed price is another form of profit for shareholders in a company.\n- Long-term Competitiveness: Shareholders are interested in the long-term competitiveness of the company they have invested in to ensure their investment will continue to produce a favourable rate of return through dividends and share price appreciation.\n- Management and Governance: Shareholders are concerned with management and governance as these impact a company's profitability and share prices.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nA dividend is a portion of a company's annual earnings distributed to its shareholders. The board of directors decides the size of the dividend, which can be in the form of cash or reinvestment in the form of additional stock.\nShareholders are concerned about the company's performance since the size of the dividend is in proportion to its earnings. Investors monitor performance indicators and study financial results to ensure they get a good return on their investment.\nOther than dividends, growth in the value of shares through a positive difference in the share purchase price and the current listed price is another form of profit for shareholders in a company. The value of shares increases if a company's performance is financially favourable. Conversely, the value of shares can fall below the purchase price if the financial performance is not up to expectations.\nApart from a company's financial results and fundamentals, market sentiment significantly impacts share prices. The market sentiment may be related to factors affecting a company's reputation, general economic trends or news which affect the company's future performance.\nShareholders are concerned about the value of their investment.

The franchisees cover the costs of setting up and running their own outlets, making growth less risky and less expensive for the franchisor.\nFor Leafy Bites, franchising would allow the brand to expand into larger cities more quickly without the owners needing to invest heavily in new locations. This could help the business grow its market presence and reputation beyond its small town.\n- One disadvantage of franchising is that the franchisor loses some control over how franchisees run their outlets. This can lead to inconsistencies in product quality, customer service, and brand reputation if franchisees do not follow the original business standards.\nThe owners of Leafy Bites are concerned that by franchising, they may lose control over the high quality and personalised customer service that has been key to their success. Poor management by franchisees could harm the business’s reputation.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Mark as 2 + 2\n- Award [1] for a relevant advantage with an additional [1] for application to the case study.\n- Award [1] for a relevant disadvantage with an additional [1] for application to the case study.\n- Award a maximum of [4].\n',

However, Link Electronics has also started experiencing some challenges related to its size. Managers have reported issues with poor communication across its increasingly large production and marketing teams, leading to delays in decision-making and product launches.\nIn addition to expanding into Australia, Link Electronics is also exploring the possibility of developing a new battery technology that charges 50% faster than its current models. This could help improve the performance of its smartphones and attract customers who value fast-charging capabilities.\nThese plans are part of Link Electronics\' strategy for internal growth, focusing on expanding both its market presence and its product offerings to increase sales and profitability.\n\n- Define the term internal growth. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Identify the growth strategy XYZ Electronics is considering if they want to target a new market with their existing smartphone products. <span class="marks">[1]</span>\n\n- Explain, using the Ansoff Matrix, XYZ\'s planned development of new batteries. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Outline one economy and one diseconomy of scale that Link Electronics has experienced. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class="marks">[Maximum 9]</span>\n',

      "External growth can have advantages as well as disadvantages.\nAdvantages:\n\n- Quicker to implement: External growth is a faster way to grow compared to internal growth.\n- The benefit of synergies: Combining two organisations can bring benefits of a greater talent pool.\n- Economies of scale: External growth can give access to a larger market, creating better economies of scale.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nQuicker to implement: External growth strategies, such as mergers and acquisitions, can be implemented relatively quickly compared to the slower, more organic internal growth process. For instance, acquiring a company immediately increases the acquiring company's size, market share, and resources. This rapid expansion is particularly advantageous in fast-moving industries or when a company must adjust quickly to market changes. It's also a quick way to access new technologies, products, or markets without the time and resources needed to develop them internally.\nEconomies of scale refer to the cost advantages a business obtains due to expansion. As the scale of operation increases, the cost per production unit typically decreases. Here's how external growth can enhance economies of scale:\n\n- Increased Production: By acquiring or merging with another company, a business can increase its production capacity, leading to lower costs per unit due to the spread of fixed costs over a larger output.\n- Purchasing Power: Larger organisations often have greater bargaining power with suppliers, which can lead to reduced costs for raw materials and other inputs.\n- Market Access: Expanding into new markets (geographical or product markets) can increase the customer base, spreading the fixed costs of operations over a more extensive revenue base, thus reducing the average cost.\nThis can result in more competitive pricing, higher margins, or both, which are crucial for long-term business sustainability and market competitiveness.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n- Higher cost: External growth costs more than internal growth.\n- Greater risk: The uncertainties of external growth translate to more significant risks.\n- Culture clash: Combining two organisations can result in a culture clash.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nHigher cost: External growth comes with a high price tag. Acquisition of another organisation requires interest-bearing finance. The price for the acquisition might be high, with shareholders taking advantage and demanding a higher-than-fair price.\nGreater risk: External growth, such as mergers and acquisitions, carries greater risk due to the complexities of integrating different organisational cultures, systems, and processes. This can lead to operational disruptions and employee dissatisfaction. Additionally, the significant financial investment required for external growth poses a risk if the anticipated benefits and synergies still need to be fully realised. These challenges, coupled with potential regulatory hurdles and stakeholder resistance, make external growth a riskier strategy than internal growth's more controlled and incremental approach.\nCulture clash: Two organisations coming together during the process of external growth can experience a cultural clash due to the difference in governance and management styles. While this can be eventually resolved, the resulting conflict can result from inefficient operations and decisions, causing tangible financial losses and a dissatisfied customer base.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each advantage and disadvantage.\n2 marks for explaining each advantage and disadvantage..\nTotal - 4 marks",

The franchise model is a tried and tested business. Therefore, the risk of failure is low compared to setting up an independent business as a sole trader, for example. The business will already have an established customer base.\nAnother advantage to being a franchisee is the support and advice that can be gained from a franchisor, such as training employees and legal advice. This improves the business's chances of success as expert advice is given.\nA disadvantage to being a franchisee is the lack of freedom associated with operating under a franchise model. The franchisee must follow the processes and standards set by the franchisor, with little room for new ideas or initiatives to be implemented.\nAnother disadvantage to being a franchisee is the expenses associated with the business model. The franchisee will need to pay a franchise fee as well as the start-up costs of the business.

      'Explain two differences between internal and external growth. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n',
    markScheme:
      "Internal growth, also known as organic growth, refers to the expansion of a business through the use of its own resources and capabilities. This growth is typically achieved through increasing output, enhancing sales, or improving the business's products or services, often by reinvesting profits back into the business. It is characterized by a gradual and steady growth trajectory. External growth involves the business expanding outside its activities, commonly through mergers, acquisitions, or alliances with other businesses. This type of growth can enable a business to increase its market share, diversify its product offerings, or enter new markets more rapidly than internal growth.\n\n- Financial Cost: Internal growth is relatively inexpensive; external growth has a higher economic cost.\n- Risk: Internal growth is a less risky method of growth. External growth can entail higher risks.\n- Control and Coordination: Internal growth allows the organisation to maintain control, whereas external growth can dilute control.\n- Corporate Culture: Internal growth is the same. External growth can cause a culture clash.\n- Slower, quicker: Internal growth could be faster to implement, whereas external growth is faster to increase production/sales.\n- Talent Pool: Internal growth has a restricted talent pool. External growth can bring in a talent pool with complimenting knowledge, skills and expertise.\n- Economies of Scale: Internal growth beyond the optimal limit can result in diseconomies of scale. External growth is more likely to show economies of scale.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nRetained profits are the primary source of funding internal growth; therefore, there is negligible financing cost. The organisation might acquire an interest-bearing loan, but the size of this loan would be relatively small. Furthermore, borrowing costs would be more favourable due to the lower perceived risk.\nExternal growth often involves significant investment or financial outlay with an interest payment burden; the risk involved in external growth results in higher borrowing costs.\nInternal growth builds on the existing strengths of an organisation, such as brand value and customer loyalty. This factor, in combination with continuity in governance and management culture and the lower cost of funding growth, adds up to a lower risk.\nExternal growth can carry more risk due to a potential clash of management culture, a higher financial cost of growth and more significant uncertainties.\nDespite the risk involved, external growth is often favoured as it is a quicker method of increasing production/sales, often bringing the advantage of a greater pool of skills.\nInternal growth allows an organisation to maintain control and implement better coordination between departments. Internal growth is, therefore, easier to execute and manage.\nExternal growth dilutes control. It can lead to difficulty in coordination and result in inefficiencies.\nIn internal growth, there is continuity of governance and corporate values, with no resulting clash of management styles.\nExternal growth can result in two organisations with vastly different management styles and cultures having to work together. The clash between these corporate cultures can lead to efficient management and effective decisions.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

      'Cooperativa Esperanza is an agricultural cooperative made up of small-scale farmers in Guatemala. By working together, these farmers pool their resources to purchase supplies in bulk, share machinery, and access larger markets to better compete with bigger agricultural businesses.\nIn light of increased competition and innovations in farming methods, the cooperative recognises the need to invest in more modern machinery. However, obtaining additional funding has proven difficult due to limited access to finance for rural businesses. The cooperative also struggles with poor local infrastructure, including unreliable transportation and limited access to technology, which further hinders efficiency and market access.\nRecently, a large publicly held company (PLC) approached Cooperativa Esperanza with a takeover offer. Some of the older members, who are close to retirement, are interested in accepting the offer as it would provide them with a secure financial exit.

      "Advantages of external growth\n\n- Quicker than organic growth $\\text{\\textemdash}$ Because external resources and funds are used, external growth is frequently a quicker option to expand and diversify.\n- Synergies $\\text{\\textemdash}$ Companies can gain from a larger talent pool, information, and outside experts.\n- Lessened competition $\\text{\\textemdash}$ Increasing the firm's market share through external growth is a quick, albeit expensive, way to lessen rivalry.\n- Economies of scale $\\text{\\textemdash}$ Businesses can access larger markets and, as a result, have economies of scale from operating on a greater scale, thanks to rapid external growth.\n- Spreading risks $\\text{\\textemdash}$ Businesses gain from diversification thanks to external growth. As a result, businesses are often less at risk of failing in a certain area of their operations.\n\nDisadvantages of external growth\n\n- More expensive than internal growth $\\text{\\textemdash}$ External growth strategies, including mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and franchising, are typically more expensive.\n- Greater risks are created by inadequate market information and the increased unpredictability of external growth.\n- Regulatory hurdles $\\text{\\textemdash}$ Governments may obstruct external growth, such as acquisitions and takeovers, if the action is considered anti-competitive.\n- Potential diseconomies of scale $\\text{\\textemdash}$ Increasing internal growth complexity can also result in inefficiencies and a consequent increase in average costs.\n- Organisational culture conflict $\\text{\\textemdash}$ It can be challenging to blend several cultures and management philosophies, particularly when external growth changes a company's character and culture.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nThe speed of external growth is one of its main benefits. External growth uses external resources and funds instead of organic growth, which depends on internal resources and labour-intensive development. This frequently causes the business to expand and diversify considerably more quickly. A privately held company can easily access new markets, clientele, and technology through mergers and acquisitions (M&As), joint ventures, strategic alliances, or franchising. This acceleration might give the privately held company a competitive advantage, especially in fast-paced industries where getting products to market quickly is critical.\nOn the other hand, external expansion tactics have some significant drawbacks, with cost being the main issue. M&As, joint ventures, and other external growth strategies are often more expensive than organic ones. Legal fees, transaction charges, integration costs, and the cost of buying already-existing assets or businesses may all be included in the costs. Furthermore, external development frequently involves a learning curve resulting in unanticipated operational or cultural difficulties. A privately held company's resources may be taxed by the costs and complications of external growth, necessitating careful planning, investigation, and risk management. For external expansion initiatives to be in line with the overall goals and long-term viability of the organisation, it is critical to strike a balance between expediency and financial ramifications.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each impact of growing externally for a privately held company.\n2 marks for explaining each impact of growing externally for a privately held company.\nTotal - 4 marks",

      '\n- Economies of Scale:\nCompanies aim to achieve economies of scale to enhance their growth prospects. This goal is driven by the desire to reduce average production costs as production volumes increase.\n\nThere are various types of economies of scale, categorised as internal and external economies of scale.\nInternal Economies of Scale\nInternal economies of scale involve adopting new technologies to enhance productivity, accessing financing at lower interest rates, employing specialised staff to improve output quality and volume, spreading advertising costs over larger production quantities, and procuring inventory in bulk at reduced rates.\nExternal Economies of Scale\nExternal economies of scale arise when a company gains access to new customer segments. For instance, an e-commerce business can significantly expand its customer base. Another example is when a company operates in an area with skilled workers, leading to lower recruitment and training expenses, thereby enhancing productivity and efficiency.\n\n- Diseconomies of Scale\nAs companies expand, their production capacity grows. However, if a company fails to operate close to its capacity, average costs and unit costs may rise, resulting in diseconomies of scale.\n\nDiseconomies of scale can be further categorized as internal and external.\nInternal Diseconomies of Scale\nInternal diseconomies of scale often arise due to communication challenges, demotivation among staff from repetitive tasks and increased workloads, bureaucratic hurdles, and slower decision-making processes stemming from larger hierarchical structures, all of which can directly impact production levels.\nExternal Diseconomies of Scale\nExternal diseconomies of scale occur when fixed costs escalate, including larger building rents due to increased production volumes and higher wages to retain skilled employees amidst increased job opportunities.',

      "Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages a business can achieve as it increases the scale of its production or operations.\nDiseconomies of scale is a situation in which a business experiences an increase in average costs as it continues to expand its production or operations.\nKey factors of economies of scale\n\n- Cost reduction: As operations' scale grows, economies of scale cause a decline in the mean production costs.\n- Efficiency: Greater production volumes result in increased resource utilisation and operational efficiency.\n- Competitive advantage: Achieving economies of scale can give a business the upper hand by enabling it to offer items at cheaper costs or of higher quality.\n- Investment in technology: Scale economies are frequently fueled by the application of cutting-edge technology and automation.\n- Specialisation: As production rises, cost savings from the specialisation of labour and resources are possible.\n- Lower manufacturing costs per unit: Lower manufacturing costs per unit translate into larger profit margins for the company.\n\nKey factors of diseconomies of scale\n\n- Cost increase: As activities continue to expand in scope, diseconomies of scale cause an increase in average production costs.\n- Efficiency issues: Managing a larger organisation may bring about efficiency issues, such as communication problems and coordination issues.\n- Complexity: As a business grows, it can become more difficult to run, which would raise administrative and operating costs.\n- Bureaucracy: More bureaucratic structures are frequently developed by larger organisations, which can impede efficiency and slow decision-making.\n- Staff morale: Due to decreased job satisfaction and a perception of being cut off from the organisation's goals, scale inefficiencies can have a detrimental impact on staff morale.\n- Adaptability: As organisations grow bigger, it is possible that they lose some of their ability to modify and respond to market demand changes.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nAs a company grows and changes in size and production volume, economies of scale and diseconomies of scale reflect two separate stages in the development of a corporation. Economies of scale, a crucial stage of growth, are identified by a number of distinctive characteristics. The most notable aspect is cost reduction$\\text{\\textemdash}$average manufacturing costs fall as operations' scale increases. This is a result of improved economies of scale-driven operational efficiencies, more effective resource utilisation, and reduced per-unit manufacturing costs. A business can offer items at more competitive pricing or of higher quality thanks to economies of scale, giving it a competitive edge and improving its market position and profitability.\nIn contrast, certain crucial elements are at play when a corporation encounters diseconomies of scale. The development of increasingly complex and bureaucratic systems in larger organisations is one of the key contributing reasons. These frameworks may inhibit decision-making and impede efficiency, which limits adaptation.\nAnother crucial element related to diseconomies of scale is adaptability. Organisations may become less able to respond to shifting consumer demands as they get bigger. It may be difficult to quickly pivot or modify tactics due to the growing complexity of operations and decision-making processes. The key distinctions between economies and diseconomies of scale highlight how crucial effective management and strategic decision-making are as a firm grows, as well as the careful balancing act needed to maximise benefits while minimising costs.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

      'PadelPro Systems is a Spain-based company founded in 2021 that designs and installs high-quality padel courts. Padel is a racket sport that blends elements of tennis and squash, and it is expanding rapidly worldwide—an opportunity the founders of PadelPro recognized early, leading them to enter the market with innovative court solutions.\nThe company serves luxury resorts, fitness centers, and publicly funded sports facilities across Europe and the Middle East. It uses customisable, weather-resistant courts built with sustainably sourced materials. In 2024, PadelPro installed over 150 courts and earned €2.3 million in revenue.\nPadelPro offers end-to-end services, including design, installation, and maintenance. It benefits from economies of scale by purchasing materials in bulk, reducing costs while maintaining quality.\nTo support international growth, PadelPro merged with a German sports construction firm and plans to expand into the U.S. market through partnerships with franchises.\n\n- Define the external growth method franchising. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Outline one difference between internal and external growth, with reference to PadelPro Systems.  <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain two reasons why PadelPro Systems might want to grow. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n- Explain two reasons why PadelPro chose a merger as a method of external growth. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class="marks">[Maximum 12]</span>\n',

      "\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- Franchising is a legal agreement where the franchisor, the original business,  allows a franchisee, an individual or business, to operate using its brand, products, and processes in exchange for fees and royalty payments.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for a basic definition of franchising, which lacks detail.\n- Award [2] for a clear and accurate definition, showing understanding of both franchisor and franchisee roles.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- \n  - Franchising is a common method of external growth that allows rapid market expansion with lower financial risk for the franchisor.\n\n- \n  - For example, PadelPro Systems plans to expand into the U.S. market through partnerships with franchises, PadelPro would act as the franchisor.\n\n- \n  - PadelPro Systems, based in Spain, owns the brand, designs, and technical knowledge. They would grant selected U.S. based individuals or businesses (the franchisees) the right to operate under the PadelProSystems brand.\n\n- \n  - The franchisees operating local businesses in the U.S. would market and install PadelPro Systems courts in the U.S. They would also benefit from training and support provided by PadelPro Systems.\n\n- \n  - In the process PadelPro Systems expands its presence and earns income without opening and managing physical offices or hiring U.S. staff directly. It gains brand recognition, revenue streams from fees/royalties and market knowledge from local partners.\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- Internal growth occurs organically using the businesses own resources, such as increasing output. For example, PadelPro Systems expanded their output to install 150 padel courts whereas external growth involves merging with another company, as PadelPro did with a German firm.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for outlining a clear difference between internal and external growth.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- Examples of Internal growth (organic growth) include:\n- \n  - Increasing output or sales.\n\n- \n  - Launching new products.\n\n- \n  - Entering new markets independently.\n\n- \n  - Investing in new technology or facilities.\n\n\n\n\n- Examples of external growth (Inorganic growth) include:\n- \n  - Mergers.and acquisitions (M&As).\n\n- \n  - Takeovers.\n\n- \n  - Strategic alliances.\n\n- \n  - Joint ventures.\n\n- \n  - Franchising.\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One reason for PadelPro Systems to grow is to increase their market share, especially as demand for padel courts rises globally.  By expanding into new markets early, PadelPro can attract more clients and establish itself as a leading provider before competitors gain traction.\n- A second reason for PadelPro Systems to grow is to achieve cost savings through economies of scale. As PadelPro grows and installs more courts across Europe and the Middle East, it can buy materials in bulk and streamline their operations, reducing average costs and increasing their profit margins.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for identifying one reason to grow.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Award [1] for identifying a second reason to grow.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- The advantages of being a small business include:\n- \n  - Lower operating costs incurred so less cash flow issues.\n\n- \n  - Easier communication between employees.\n\n- \n  - Customised services to individual customer's preferences.\n\n- \n  - Less competition in the small businesses.\n\n\n\n\n- The advantages of being a large businesses include:\n- \n  - Access to a highly skilled and experienced workforce due to greater recruitment resources.\n\n- \n  - Strong brand recognition, leading to customer loyalty and market trust.\n\n- \n  - Greater financial capacity to invest in research and development (R&D) for innovation.\n\n- \n  - Larger market share, contributing to higher sales revenue and potential economies of scale.\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One reason to merge with a German construction firm is to expand geographically. By partnering with a company already established in Germany, PadelPro can benefit from the local firm’s existing customer base and supplier networks. This reduces the costs and risks associated with entering a foreign market alone and allows them to access new clients, such as sports clubs and luxury resorts more efficiently than through internal (organic) growth.\n- A second reason to merge with a German construction firm is to achieve synergies by sharing technical expertise and Research & Development costs for new padel court technologies. As a result, collaboration on innovation can accelerate the development of advanced, weather-resistant court designs, providing a clear competitive advantage.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for identifying one reason to merge.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Award [1] for identifying a second reason to merge.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- Further advantages of Mergers are:\n- \n  - Economies of scale. Reduced average costs are achieved through bulk buying, shared operations, and combined infrastructure.\n\n- \n  - Diversification. Merging with a different but related business reduces risk across markets or product lines.\n\n",

      "Reasons small businesses are successful:\n\n- Cost control: A business could have higher unit production costs if it expands. Many large businesses will face diseconomies of scale when they grow too big.\n- Specialisation: Smaller firms can operate in nice markets where there is less competition, and they can earn higher profits.\n- Privacy: Financial accounts of smaller businesses may not need to be made public. Competitors cannot access their profit and loss accounts and balance sheets.\n- Ownership and control: Some business owners may want their business to remain small to remain in control.\n- Personalisation: Small businesses can offer a personalised service to their customers, which can create customer loyalty.\n- Government aid: Grants and subsidies may be offered to smaller businesses to help them set up and develop.\n- Flexibility: Smaller businesses can better adapt to market changes, such as trends and customer wants.\n- Local monopoly power: Smaller businesses may be located in remote areas where large businesses would not want to operate. Often, they can be the only business in that industry in the area.\n- Tax incentives: Often, the owners of small businesses can claim tax deductions for business expenses.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$: \nSmall businesses can sometimes succeed due to the personalised service they can offer their customers. Smaller businesses can develop good customer relationships, creating customer loyalty and providing a competitive advantage over their larger rivals.\nSmaller businesses may operate in niche markets, providing specialised products which larger businesses may not see the value in selling. There is limited competition in a niche market, so selling here can be highly profitable. This allows the smaller businesses to thrive in this area.\nSmaller businesses may benefit from tax deductions for expenses related to running the business. These expenses can include equipment, supplies, or training. This makes running the business cheaper than the larger rivals.\nSmaller businesses are more flexible than larger organisations and will be able to adapt quickly to changes in the market. This includes catering to customer's wants and needs and current trends. Larger organisations have greater commitments in terms of finance and shareholder objectives to keep in mind.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each reason small businesses are successful.\n2 marks for explaining each reason small businesses are successful.\nTotal - 4 marks",

For Pure Essence, this includes hiring more staff, acquiring additional raw materials and equipment, and renting extra storage space to increase production of popular products like the aloe vera moisturiser.\n  External growth, on the other hand, involves a business expanding through partnerships or collaborations with other organisations. Pure Essence's possible joint venture with a leading animal rights group would be an example of external growth because they would be working with an outside organisation that is not part of the business.\n  Mark allocation:\n  Award [1] for stating the concept of internal growth.\nAward [1] for explaining internal growth with application to Pure Essence.\nAward [1] for stating the concept of external growth.\nAward [1] for explaining external growth with application to Pure Essence.\nUp to a maximum of [4].\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One reason a business should consider entering a joint venture is that it could enhance business growth by expanding market reach and improving brand image. Partnering with a respected animal rights organisation can significantly strengthen Pure Essence’s ethical image and cruelty-free credentials. This association appeals to the growing segment of consumers who value animal welfare and ethical production and builds greater customer trust and loyalty.\n- One reason a business should not enter a joint venture is the challenge of managing limited resources during rapid expansion. Small businesses often face difficulties scaling operations due to staff, finances, and infrastructure constraints, which can hinder their ability to take on additional commitments.

      'Shoon is a publicly-held, fast fashion retailer, operating in numerous countries across the world. Its primary manufacturing facility is located in Bangladesh, where it produces large volumes of affordable, fashionable clothing for global markets. The company’s manufacturing operations in Bangladesh have created thousands of jobs for local people, providing much-needed employment opportunities in a country where work is often hard to find.\nHowever, Shoon has faced growing criticism over the working conditions within its factories. Reports suggest that many employees work long hours for very low pay, raising concerns about exploitation and the ethical standards of the business. Recently, rumours have surfaced that Shoon may soon relocate its manufacturing operations to a different country. This speculation comes in response to an anticipated increase in the minimum wage by the Bangladeshi government, which could make it more expensive for Shoon to continue its operations there.\nIn addition to labour concerns, Shoon’s denim manufacturing process has drawn criticism for its labour-intensive nature and high water usage. Local farmers have complained that the factory’s water consumption is contributing to droughts in surrounding agricultural areas, placing further strain on the environment and local communities who rely on water for their crops and livelihoods.\n\n- Define the term multinational company. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- State two features of a publicly held company. <span class="marks">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain one benefit and two drawbacks for Bangladesh of hosting the multinational company (MNC) Shoon. <span class="marks">[6]</span>\n\n\n<span class="marks">[Maximum 10]</span>\n',

Shoon provides thousands of jobs to local workers in its factories, which helps reduce unemployment and offers a source of income in a country where jobs can be difficult to find. This employment can contribute to economic growth and help improve living standards for some individuals and their families.\n- A significant drawback is the risk of worker exploitation. As seen in Shoon's case, workers may face long hours and very low pay, which raises ethical concerns and highlights how multinationals might prioritise low costs over employee welfare. This can lead to dissatisfaction and social tensions within the local population.\n- Another drawback is the environmental damage caused by some multinational operations. Shoon’s labour-intensive and water-heavy manufacturing processes have led to complaints from local farmers about droughts, suggesting that such companies can contribute to environmental degradation, harming agriculture and local livelihoods.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Mark as 2 + [2 + 2]\n- Award [1] for identifying one benefit for a Bangladesh for hosting Shoon and an additional [1] for explaining it up to a maximum of [2].\n- For each benefit mark as 2 + 2.\n- Award [1] for identifying a drawback for Bangladesh for hosting Shoon  and an additional [1] for explaining it up to a maximum of [2].\n- Award a maximum of [6].\n",

      'Some of the opportunities a business operating overseas can benefit from are:\n\n- Expanded customer base: Operating overseas allows the business to increase sales revenue by accessing a new customer base. This growth in market size is a significant advantage for businesses that experience saturation in their domestic markets or those looking to expand rapidly.\n- Cheaper production cost: Expanding into some overseas markets can result in lower manufacturing costs for a business. In the fourth quarter of the last century, several big brand businesses started taking advantage of the improvements in infrastructure and the availability of a skilled workforce to set up manufacturing units in developing countries. The governments in these countries provided added economic incentives to attract MNCs.\n- Access to resources: Another major incentive for an MNC to expand overseas is gaining access to raw materials. For example, it is more economical to ship 1 ton of extracted iron than 2 tons of iron ore. The cost of raw materials can be lower in countries with abundant raw materials. Overseas expansion can provide access to new technology. Some MNCs will set up overseas operations to acquire a qualified talent pool that would bring expertise and innovation into the business.\n\nSome threats an MNC can face when expanding overseas are:\n\n- Political instability: An MNC can face problems caused by political instability and geopolitical friction in some foreign markets. Evolving politics in unstable but lucrative markets can have an adverse effect through a change in government policy or an economic slump. A new government might take away incentives the previous government provided, making the operation unviable. Geopolitical conflict can disrupt operations and cause financial losses.\n- Cultural challenges: Differences in culture and language barriers can impede managing an overseas operation successfully. MNCs need to be aware of and adapt to local cultural norms. Local regulatory environments can be challenging, especially in countries with an evolving political system.\n- Exchange rate: Fluctuations in exchange rates can affect profitability and even the viability of overseas operations. The cost of raw materials and the finished product prices can change rapidly, making it difficult to plan or guarantee cash flow and financial outcomes.\n\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each oppotunity and threat.\n2 marks for explaining each oppotunity and threat.\nTotal - 4 marks',

      "Reasons for why businesses strive to become MNCs\n\n- Increase customer base\n- Cheaper production costs\n- Economies of scale\n- Brand development\n- Brand value\n- Avoid protectionist policies\n- Spread risk\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}$: \nBusinesses frequently pursue Multinational Corporation (MNC) status for various compelling reasons. The desire to grow their consumer base is one of the main motivators. Businesses can access new markets and demographics by going global and having a presence there. Through risk diversification, this not only increases their customer base but also lessens their reliance on a single market. Accessing a broader and more varied customer base can improve the stability of the company and present chances for long-term success.\nAnother factor is the desire for lower production costs, a key driving force for companies aspiring to become MNCs. Businesses can take advantage of cost benefits in various regions by establishing operations in numerous nations. This can mean using more affordable raw resources, lower labour costs, or hospitable regulatory regimes in particular nations. Increased profitability is a result of lower manufacturing costs, which also provide businesses more freedom to compete successfully in price-sensitive markets. Cost-effective production can also lessen the effects of economic changes and improve a company's worldwide competitiveness, which promotes long-term success. In this approach, the drive to become an MNC is frequently a tactical response to the need to maximise market share and achieve cost reductions.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each reason.\n2 marks for explaining each reason.\nTotal - 4 marks",

On the plus side, MNCs can greatly aid in creating jobs in the host nation. Local workers are frequently hired by these firms when they establish their operations, which lowers unemployment rates and gives local workers vital possibilities. In turn, this raises the general level of living for the inhabitants of the host nation and encourages economic stability. MNCs often bring substantial investments, technologies and resources, which lead to increased economic output and tax revenues. The host country can benefit from enhanced trade and export opportunities, contributing to a higher gross domestic product (GDP). Foreign capital and expertise can stimulate economic growth and development, improving living standards and public infrastructure.\nRecognising that MNC influence can be two-sided because adverse effects can occur in host nations. The potential loss of jobs is one of these detrimental effects. Local labour may be displaced if MNCs adopt more effective production techniques or outsource specific tasks. Even though MNCs generate jobs, some will likely be lost due to the inability to adapt to the changing labour market, which could exacerbate income inequality and social problems. A percentage of the profits MNCs make in the host country are frequently sent back to the country where the company was founded. This could lead to a drain on the host country's financial resources, reducing the ability to reinvest earnings in local projects.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each impacts.\n2 marks for explaining each impacts.\nTotal - 4 marks",
