Over time, as these icy bodies collided with Earth, they contributed to the accumulation of water on the planet\'s surface. Choice A is correct.\nChoice B  is incorrect, as water was present on Earth before early organisms were present. Choice C is incorrect because free oxygen atoms were absent in the early atmosphere.

Hydrated minerals contain water in their crystal structures. Hydrated minerals originating from meteorites can become dehydrated through heating, releasing water vapour into the surroundings and leaving behind anhydrous minerals; Choice D is correct.\nWater molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen atoms, each of which can exist as different isotopes. In planetary science, scientists compare the ratios of these isotopes (such as the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio or the $^{18}O/^{16}O$ ratio) to trace the origin of water.\nChoice A is incorrect because it implies that meteorites contain ice with exactly the same isotopes as those in Earth’s oceans. In reality, all water contains the same possible isotopes, but the key evidence lies in the relative proportions of these isotopes. Some meteorites contain water with a similar isotopic ratio to Earth's oceans, not an identical isotopic composition. Therefore, the claim is misleading.\nCohesion is a process that does not require anything but water molecules, it is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Some evidence of amino acids has been found in meteorites, but no evidence of polypeptides. Choice B is incorrect.\nMeteorites travel through the vacuum of space, where temperatures are far too low to sustain liquid water.

However, water is not good at dissolving non-polar molecules because there is no attraction between water molecules and non-polar molecules. Statement II is therefore not true.\nChoices A, B and D are incorrect as they all include Statement II.',

This polarity allows water to form chemical bonds with rock-forming minerals, leading to hydrated compounds such as gypsum ($\\ce{CaSO_4.H_2O}$) and hydrated feldspars. These minerals incorporate water into their crystal structures (known as water of crystallisation), helping retain water in the Earth's crust before the appearance of life; Choice C is correct.\nHigh heat capacity refers to water’s ability to store heat without large temperature changes, which helps to regulate Earth’s climate, but doesn’t explain why water is retained on Earth; Choice A is incorrect. \nWater is described as a universal solvent as it can dissolve a wide range of substances; however, while water is required for condensation reactions, the process of condensation does not trap water in a manner that would keep it on Earth. Also, biological polymers did not exist until after life emerged. Choice B is incorrect. \nIf water had entered the mantle, the heat there would cause it to evaporate instantly, and therefore, water would not be retained on Earth.

Choice B is the correct answer to this question.\nWhile surface tension is a property of water, it does not directly contribute to the formation of proto-cell membranes (Statement I) in the context of early cellular evolution. Proto-cell membranes are primarily formed by the self-assembly of amphipathic molecules like phospholipids, which align themselves in a bilayer in water due to their hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.\nOrganic molecules needed to remain in suspension for interactions, rather than settling quickly (Statement III).

    markScheme:
      'A\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nScientists face significant challenges replicating the exact environmental conditions of early Earth because our understanding of its atmosphere, temperature, pressure, and chemical composition billions of years ago is limited; Choice A is correct.\nThe first cells appeared billions of years ago and are now extinct. Modern cells are descendants but not the original first cells; Choice B is incorrect.\nThere is very limited or no direct fossil evidence of the first protocells because they were microscopic, soft-bodied, and lacked durable structures that fossilise well. The lack, rather than the abundance, of fossil evidence is a key challenge to testing the hypothesis about the origin of the first cells; Choice C is incorrect.\nCurrent scientific understanding strongly supports that protocells contained early forms of genetic material, such as RNA molecules. RNA is believed to have played a dual role as both a genetic material and a catalyst (ribozymes), making it central to hypotheses like the RNA world hypothesis.\nNucleic acids are crucial because they enable self-replication and heredity, essential for the evolution of life. Choice D contradicts the accepted hypotheses and is therefore incorrect.',

Natural selection is driven by random mutations that may or may not benefit an organism; Choice A  is incorrect. Although natural selection via evolution did allow the last universal common ancestor to outcompete other organisms, it is likely to have been a gradual process that did not occur within one generation; Choice B is incorrect.

If different forms of life had arisen independently, it is highly unlikely that they would all use the same genetic code.\nThe machinery for protein synthesis,  (Statement II) which includes ribosomes, transfer RNA (tRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA), is remarkably conserved across all forms of cellular life. This high degree of similarity suggests that these complex molecular mechanisms were inherited from a common ancestor, known as the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).\nATP as a common energy currency  (Statement III) used by organisms as diverse as bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes suggests that this energy system was established early in the evolutionary history of life and inherited from a single ancestral organism.

This results in them needing exchange systems, such as the circulatory and respiratory systems, to manage waste removal and to acquire essential substances such as oxygen and nutrients. In contrast, unicellular organisms can rely on simple diffusion. Choice C  is correct.\nChoice A  is incorrect because although multicellular organisms often have a larger body size than unicellular organisms, this can be advantageous to them. Choice B  is incorrect, as multicellular organisms adapting to their environment more easily is an advantage. Choice D  is incorrect, as cell differentiation, where cells become specialised for specific functions, is an advantage as it allows for the division of labour amongst cells.',

When the larger cells engulfed the smaller cells, the smaller cells gained a second membrane ($\\checkmark$) as they were engulfed via endocytosis. Further evidence for the theory is that chloroplasts and mitochondria contain their own 70s ribosomes ($\\checkmark$) so can make their own proteins, and also contain their own DNA ($\\checkmark$) so can carry out transcription ($\\checkmark$). Chloroplasts and mitochondria are also able to divide in a similar manner to prokaryotic cells ($\\checkmark$).\n\n\nA quality mark is awarded if each part of the question (a, b, c) is answered to earn at least half of the points available, answers do not require re-reading to be understood, and there are almost no errors and little irrelevant information. <span class="marks">[1]</span>\n',

      'C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nPalisade mesophyll cells are cells in the leaves of plants that produce carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Since photosynthesis takes place within chloroplasts, these cells contain a high density of chloroplasts They also contain a large central vacuole, which occupies the space at the center of the cell and helps maintain the turgor pressure in the cell. The position of the central vacuole ensures the chloroplasts will be pushed near the edges of the cell, where they can receive light. Additionally, the vacuole acts as a storage reservoir for water and other nutrients needed for photosynthesis.\nChoice A and Choice D are incorrect because mitochondria are the site of aerobic respiration, during which carbohydrates are broken down to produce ATP. Choice D is also incorrect as the Golgi apparatus packages proteins, not carbohydrates, for export, so Choice B  is also incorrect.',

This means two populations might look different but still interbreed, or might appear similar but already be reproductively isolated. Because divergence doesn’t follow a fixed pattern, deciding when to define them as separate species becomes subjective.\nStatement II is true because Populations might develop noticeable differences in traits (such as colouration or mating calls), but still produce fertile offspring when they interbreed. According to the biological species concept, they’re technically the same species, but these differences can confuse classification.\nStatement III is false because often, the opposite is true. Genetic differences (mutations, allele frequency changes) may accumulate before any visible morphological change occurs. For example, two populations may look identical but carry distinct genetic markers and be reproductively isolated.\nSaying morphological change “always” comes first is incorrect and overly simplistic.\nChoice A is correct because it includes only the two true Statements I and II.\nChoices B, C and D are incorrect as they include the false Statement III.',

Its sequence differs enough between species to allow clear differentiation, yet it remains consistent within individuals of the same species. This makes it highly effective for DNA barcoding.\nChoice A is incorrect: If the cytochrome oxidase I gene were too highly conserved (i.e., nearly identical across species), it wouldn’t provide enough variation to distinguish one species from another.\nChoice C is incorrect. The cytochrome oxidase I gene is not exclusive to animals; it is found in the mitochondria of many eukaryotes. Its utility for animal barcoding comes from its pattern of variability, not its exclusivity.\nChoice D is incorrect. The cytochrome oxidase I gene is mitochondrial, not nuclear, and its evolutionary rate is moderate rather than extremely rapid.

However, it does not apply to organisms that reproduce exclusively asexually.\nStatement III is false. The number of offspring does not affect the applicability of the biological species concept. The issue is the absence of sexual reproduction, not the offspring count.\nChoice A is correct because it contains only the true statement and none of the false ones.\nChoice B is incorrect because it contains the false Statement III.\nChoice C is incorrect because it contains the false Statement I.\nChoice D is incorrect because it contains the false Statements I and III.',

Choice A is, therefore, not correct.\nComparative anatomy involves comparing the structures of different organisms to understand their evolutionary relationships. While it can provide evidence of common ancestry and evolutionary trends, it does not offer a precise method for estimating the time of divergence between species based on genetic differences. Choice C is, therefore, not correct.\nStudying the distribution of fossils within sedimentary rock layers establishes relative ages and the chronological order of geological and evolutionary events. Whilst it is essential for constructing the timeline of life on Earth, it does not use genetic differences to estimate divergence times between species. Choice D is, therefore, not correct.',

For example, some segments of a population may respond to a particular mating call or mating behaviour not expressed by another segment of the population.\nGeographic isolation (Choice B) occurs when populations are prevented from interbreeding because they are in different physical locations. In this question they are in the same location, therefore this is incorrect. Stabilising selection (Choice C) is a type of natural selection that promotes an intermediate phenotype, so extremes are reduced, and it does not result in speciation. Directional selection (Choice D) is a type of natural selection that promotes an extreme phenotype, but the selection is in one direction so it does not divide the population and so does not lead to speciation.

Mating, and thus hybridisation, is unlikely or impossible if members of one bird species fail to recognise the mating calls of another bird species (Statement III).  Statement I is not a barrier to hybridisation because, typically, animals with even numbers of chromosomes in their somatic cells can reproduce sexually, but those with odd numbers are usually sterile due to an inability of their cells to undergo meiosis.',

      'A\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice A is correct because there is a higher percentage similarity for the cytochrome c amino acid sequence between the human and chimpanzee (99%) compared to the human and mouse (87%). This indicates less time for mutations to accumulate, meaning humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor more recently than humans and mice.\nChoice B is incorrect because although the cytochrome c percentage similarity is lower in chickens (75%) than in mice (87%), this alone does not confirm that cytochrome c evolved faster in the chicken lineage. To determine evolutionary rates, both sequence similarity and known divergence times are needed.\nChoice C is incorrect because the lowest sequence similarity (50%) between human and zebrafish suggests the longest time since divergence, not the most recent.\nChoice D is incorrect because differences in sequence similarity alone cannot demonstrate variation in molecular clock rates. The molecular clock is a concept based on the idea that mutations accumulate at a relatively constant rate over time in most species. To conclude rate differences, both the time since divergence and the number of accrued changes must both be known.',

      'B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nSexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes from two individuals, resulting in offspring with a combination of genetic material. This process increases genetic variation, which is essential for evolution and natural selection. Choice B is the correct answer.\nPolyploidy occurs when an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes (e.g., triploid 3n, tetraploid 4n). The definition given in the table describes diploidy (2n), which is the standard chromosome number in most sexually reproducing organisms; Choice A incorrect.\nInterbreeding between different species can sometimes produce infertile offspring, such as a horse × donkey = mule. This is an example of reproductive isolation because the hybrid offspring is sterile, preventing gene flow between the two species. However, because horses and donkeys are already separate species, this does not result in speciation—it simply reinforces their reproductive barrier. For reproductive isolation to lead to speciation, it must occur within a single species, preventing interbreeding between different populations.

The calcium ions bind to troponin, which causes a conformational change ($\\checkmark$), lifting the tropomyosin and, exposing sites to which myosin can bind ($\\checkmark$). The binding of the myosin head to the actin causes the release of inorganic phosphate, and the change in the angle of the myosin head, pulling the actin filament along ($\\checkmark$). ADP is released from the myosin head, which allows ATP to bind to the myosin in its place ($\\checkmark$), causing the cross-bridge between the actin and myosin to break ($\\checkmark$).

    markScheme:
      'B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice B is correct because adaptive radiation refers to the rapid diversification and speciation of a single ancestral species into multiple descendent species, taking advantage of different niches within a community. Choice A is incorrect as natural selection refers to organisms with advantageous traits having a greater chance of survival and so a greater chance to reproduce and pass on those traits to future generations within that population, leading to the evolution of species over time.  Choice C is incorrect as it refers to the phenomenon where an organism changes in response to new environmental conditions through natural selection and random mutations, while adaptive radiation involves the rapid evolution of more than one species from a single ancestral species. Choice D is incorrect, as analogous traits do not result from common ancestry.',

    markScheme:
      'C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nAllopolyploidy arises from hybridisation between two different species, followed by chromosome doubling. The key point is that it introduces a new set of chromosomes from a different species rather than simply doubling an existing diploid genome.\nIn contrast, autopolyploidy occurs within a single species and results in an exact doubling (or higher multiple) of its own chromosome set.  Choice C is, therefore, the correct answer.\nChoice A is incorrect because hybrid vigour is often a direct result of allopolyploidy. New alleles are introduced into a species, giving an immediate selective advantage to that plant species.\nChoice B is incorrect because allopolyploidy allows new varieties that are well adapted to different local abiotic and biotic conditions. This characteristic can explain the widespread global cultivation of wheat (Triticum aestivum) as a staple crop.\nChoice D is incorrect because the new alleles brought in from new species allow a species to compete in a territory or habitat that it had not otherwise been successful in, allowing an invasive species to outcompete the native species in many cases.',

      'B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice B is correct because speciation through polyploidy is common in smartweed; if the resulting chromosome number is odd (here 3n), then the plants will become reproductively isolated from the 2n population, even though they are in the same geographic location. This is, therefore, an example of polyploidy and sympatric speciation.\nChoice A is incorrect because, although bonobos and chimpanzees were geographically isolated from each other (allopatric speciation), there was no increase in the chromosome number during the speciation event.  Choice C is incorrect because the lava fields geographically isolated the tortoises, leading to sub-species forming. This is, therefore, an ongoing allopatric speciation event, not sympatric, and it does not involve polyploidy. The tetraploid frog resulted from a polyploidy speciation event that resulted in reproductive isolation. This did not involve spatial separation, so cannot be regarded as allopatric speciation; therefore, Choice D is also incorrect.',

      "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice B is correct because both Lamarckism and epigenetic inheritance propose that environmental factors can cause inherited changes, while Lamarckism suggested these changes were permanent and led to evolution through traits acquired during an organism's lifetime. Epigenetic changes involve reversible chemical modifications to DNA or histone proteins that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. These epigenetic changes can be passed to offspring, but often only persist for a few generations and typically do not lead to long-term evolutionary change.\nChoice A is incorrect because neither Lamarckism nor epigenetic inheritance involves changes to the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetics modifies gene expression through chemical tags, while Lamarckism assumed physical or behavioural changes were inherited.\nChoice C is incorrect because only Lamarckism proposed that the use or disuse of traits directly causes evolutionary change. Epigenetic inheritance does not involve the use or disuse of structures but rather chemical changes to gene regulation influenced by environmental factors.

Nature reserves increase the chances of successful re-introduction, although many other measures would have to be taken to ensure success. \nChoice A is incorrect because building more captive breeding areas will not increase the chances of being able to reintroduce species back into the wild. \nChoice B is incorrect because, whilst artificial selection would allow desirable traits to be selected for in captivity, this would not necessarily guarantee that species would thrive or even survive in a wild habitat again. Artificial selection would also take a long time (measured in years and decades for some species in particular), as successive generations are bred. \nChoice C is incorrect because having more animals in captivity and plants in botanical gardens would do little to increase the chances of those species being successfully reintroduced to the wild.

      'An investigation was carried out into the effects of household detergents on aquatic habitats. Scientists tested the effect of different household detergents on the surface tension of water in order to better understand the impact they may have on organisms living on the surface.\nA paper clip was folded slightly on one side and rested on the surface of the water, maintained at a constant temperature and contained within a water tank. Drops of detergent solution were slowly added to the water tank until the paperclip sank to the bottom. The volume of detergent solution taken to sink the paperclip was recorded.\nDetergent solutions were made by adding 5 ml of detergent to 15 ml of water.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/84d7bb7a-360e-4fcc-8359-01fe66042fd4/images/9e71bc21-aad0-4144-8d02-95f90edc6509/BI0769A.png)\n\n\n[© Revision Village 2022.

The use of four chemically distinct nitrogenous bases arranged in long chains.\n- B.  Semiconservative replication via complementary base pairing, which preserves sequence diversity.\n- C.

The human genome is about 3,000,000,000 nucleotides long, so there would be** $\\mathbf{4^{3,000,000,000}}$ theoretical combinations of nucleotides.\nChoice B is incorrect because complementary base pairing ensures faithful replication, but does not itself generate new sequences.\nChoice C is incorrect because the antiparallel backbone ensures the strands are arranged in opposite directions, but does not contribute to the sequence diversity.\nChoice D is incorrect because coiling allows DNA to be compacted and stored efficiently within the nucleus, but it does not directly contribute to the capacity to encode genetic information. While necessary for packaging long DNA molecules, coiling does not influence the number of unique sequences that DNA can carry or its ability to store diverse instructions.',

Samples are rapidly frozen to preserve their natural state before an electron beam is passed through, allowing the structure of individual molecules to be studied.\nChoice A is incorrect because freeze-fracture electron microscopy is primarily used to study cellular structures, such as the internal arrangement of membranes. While it involves rapid freezing and can produce 3D images, it does not resolve molecular or atomic details of protein structures.\nChoice B is incorrect because fluorescent staining is used in light microscopy to identify specific molecules, such as proteins, in cells. Fluorescent dyes or antibodies emit specific wavelengths of light, highlighting target molecules, but they do not provide detailed structural information about proteins.\nChoice D is incorrect because immunofluorescence identifies specific proteins in cells or tissues using fluorescently tagged antibodies. While it is useful for locating proteins, it is not a technique for analysing protein structure at the molecular level.',

The organism pumping out of excess water is a mechanism to keep its osmolarity stable and different from the outside of the cell. Therefore, Choice D is correct.\nThe organism is not taking in or making any substance for energy and growth, so Choice A is incorrect.\nExcess water may be considered a waste product. However, the primary purpose of the pump is to regulate osmolarity and prevent lysis. Waste products typically refer to metabolic wastes like carbon dioxide or nitrogenous compounds. Therefore, Choice B is incorrect.\nThe active pumping out of water is the organism's way of maintaining internal conditions rather than just a direct response to the stimulus, and so Choice C is incorrect.",

This means two populations might look different but still interbreed, or might appear similar but already be reproductively isolated. Because divergence doesn’t follow a fixed pattern, deciding when to define them as separate species becomes subjective.\nStatement II is true because Populations might develop noticeable differences in traits (such as colouration or mating calls), but still produce fertile offspring when they interbreed. According to the biological species concept, they’re technically the same species, but these differences can confuse classification.\nStatement III is false because often, the opposite is true. Genetic differences (mutations, allele frequency changes) may accumulate before any visible morphological change occurs. For example, two populations may look identical but carry distinct genetic markers and be reproductively isolated.\nSaying morphological change “always” comes first is incorrect and overly simplistic.\nChoice A is correct because it includes only the two true Statements I and II.\nChoices B, C and D are incorrect as they include the false Statement III.',

To start the process, drugs are used to downregulate several reproductive hormones to better control the release and maturation of follicles later on ($\\checkmark$). The downregulation of FSH stops follicles from growing ($\\checkmark$). Drugs are also used to downregulate LH, which results in the prevention of ovulation  ($\\checkmark$). The downregulation of LH and FSH also results in the downregulation of oestrogen and progesterone  ($\\checkmark$), which normally function to stimulate the build-up of the uterine lining($\\checkmark$) and maintain the uterine lining ($\\checkmark$), respectively. Once these hormones are successfully downregulated, high doses of FSH are injected to trigger the development of multiple follicles in the ovary($\\checkmark$). The development of many follicles increases the chance of successful fertilisation during the IVF process ($\\checkmark$). GnRH agonists are injected to prevent premature ovulation ($\\checkmark$), and hCG is injected to stimulate the follicles to mature ($\\checkmark$).\n  A quality mark is awarded if each part of the question (a, b, c) is answered to earn at least half of the points available, answers do not require re-reading to be understood, and there are almost no errors and little irrelevant information.\n',

This is possible because variation exists within a population ($\\checkmark$). When a population becomes reproductively isolated by a geographical barrier like a river ($\\checkmark$), both groups are exposed to different environmental conditions or selective pressures ($\\checkmark$). Over time, the two groups evolve differently as different mutations affect both groups, this is referred to as differential selection ($\\checkmark$). These differences between the populations act as barriers to gene flow ($\\checkmark$). Over time, the groups evolve so differently that they can no longer interbreed and are two distinct species ($\\checkmark$).\n\n\nA quality mark is awarded if each part of the question (a, b, c) is answered to earn at least half of the points available, answers do not require re-reading to be understood, and there are almost no errors and little irrelevant information. <span class="marks">[1]</span>\n',

In fact, their function may differ considerably, for example, the forelimbs of bats for flight versus the flippers of dolphins for swimming. Homology is established based on shared structural origin, not shared function; Statement I is false.\nHomologous structures are anatomical features found in different species that share a common evolutionary origin, even if they have diverged in form or function. Both bats and dolphins have a pentadactyl limb structure in their forelimbs, despite a differing external appearance and function. This reflects divergent evolution from a shared ancestor; Statement II is true.\nBat wings and insect wings are analogous structures. Although they perform a similar function (flight), they evolved independently in different evolutionary lineages and do not share embryological origin. Bat wings derive from the vertebrate limb, while insect wings arise from outgrowths of the arthropod exoskeleton.

    markScheme:
      "B\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice B is correct because both Lamarckism and epigenetic inheritance propose that environmental factors can cause inherited changes, while Lamarckism suggested these changes were permanent and led to evolution through traits acquired during an organism's lifetime. Epigenetic changes involve reversible chemical modifications to DNA or histone proteins that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. These epigenetic changes can be passed to offspring, but often only persist for a few generations and typically do not lead to long-term evolutionary change.\nChoice A is incorrect because neither Lamarckism nor epigenetic inheritance involves changes to the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetics modifies gene expression through chemical tags, while Lamarckism assumed physical or behavioural changes were inherited.\nChoice C is incorrect because only Lamarckism proposed that the use or disuse of traits directly causes evolutionary change. Epigenetic inheritance does not involve the use or disuse of structures but rather chemical changes to gene regulation influenced by environmental factors. Furthermore, epigenetics does not lead to evolution.\nChoice D is incorrect because epigenetic inheritance does not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself and therefore does not cause long-term evolutionary change.",

Recycling and reusing products means fewer resources will be extracted from the Earth which is a process that can destroy natural habitats and lead to excessive landfill use, so Statement II is correct.

Asteroid impacts are natural events and are not caused by human activities. However, they have played a significant role in past mass extinctions, such as the event that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Choice D is therefore correct.\nWhen humans overhunt (Choice A) it can lead to a decline in populations and, in some cases, extinction. Deforestation (Choice B) is another human activity. The clearing of forests for purposes such as agriculture, logging or urban development, can destroy habitats and disrupt ecosystems, leading to extinction of species that rely on those habitats. When humans introduce new diseases to ecosystems (Choice C), either accidentally or deliberately, it can have devastating effects on native species and bring about extinction.  Choices A, B  and C  are therefore incorrect.',

      'D\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice D is correct because, like the vast majority of animal species that live on Earth today, this species had been unknown to humans. It has existed in remote areas away from human habitation, in a niche that makes it a rare global species. As such, it was not discovered until 2023, when human intervention to prevent habitat loss to palm oil farming identified the species. \nChoice A is incorrect because Chilobrachys huahini is a distinct species; only members of the same species can reproduce successfully and produce fertile offspring. \nChoice B is incorrect because there is no evidence of the recent emergence of this species; it is more likely to have been undiscovered for a long time. \nChoice C is incorrect because all spiders, including the tarantula, belong to the class Arachnida (arachnids). The key difference is the number of pairs of legs; insects have 3 pairs, whereas arachnids have 4 pairs.',

    markScheme:
      'D\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice D is correct because the transfer of ex-situ to in-situ means the return of species from captivity to areas that could become their natural habitats again. Nature reserves increase the chances of successful re-introduction, although many other measures would have to be taken to ensure success. \nChoice A is incorrect because building more captive breeding areas will not increase the chances of being able to reintroduce species back into the wild. \nChoice B is incorrect because, whilst artificial selection would allow desirable traits to be selected for in captivity, this would not necessarily guarantee that species would thrive or even survive in a wild habitat again. Artificial selection would also take a long time (measured in years and decades for some species in particular), as successive generations are bred. \nChoice C is incorrect because having more animals in captivity and plants in botanical gardens would do little to increase the chances of those species being successfully reintroduced to the wild. A large captive population serves no natural purpose to conservation unless a species is released into the wild at some stage. Keeping species in captive breeding might be called ‘preservation’, but it is not ‘conservation’ in its truest sense.',

      'The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) has been described as a species that promotes biodiversity. Beavers are herbivores that feed on freshwater plants and tree bark.
