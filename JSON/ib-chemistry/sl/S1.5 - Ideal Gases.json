Starting from $PV=nRT,$ and substituting $n = \\frac{m}{M},$ we obtain\n$PV = \\dfrac{mRT}{M}$\nwhich rearranges to\n$M = \\dfrac{mRT}{PV}$\nConverting the volume to $\\textrm{dm}^3$ (because $1 \\textrm{\\ J} = 1 \\textrm{\\ kPa dm}^3),$ and substituting the given values\n$M = \\dfrac{1.43 \\textrm{\\ g} \\times 8.31 \\textrm{\\ J mol}^{-1} \\times 298.15 \\textrm{\\ K}}{\\textrm{\\ 100 \\textrm kPa} \\times {0.500 \\textrm{\\ dm}^3}} = 70.9 \\textrm{\\ g mol}^{-1}$\nComparing this value with the molar masses of the candidate gases we can identify the unknown: hydrogen $(\\ce{H2}, \\ 2.02 \\textrm{\\ g mol}^{-1}),$ oxygen $(\\ce{O2},\\ 32.00 \\textrm{\\ g mol}^{-1}),$ carbon dioxide $(\\ce{CO2},\\ 44.01 \\textrm{\\ g mol}^{-1}),$ and chlorine $(\\ce{Cl2},\\ 70.90 \\textrm{\\ g mol}^{-1}).$ The measured value corresponds to chlorine.\nThis is a challenging question because it requires students to combine experimental data with the ideal gas equation to infer an unknown identity, rather than relying on a direct recall of facts.",
