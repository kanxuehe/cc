This would allow her to be creative with her baking recipes and cakes’ designs and to run Rocket Bakes how she wants.As a sole trader, she has unlimited liability, meaning her personal savings and possessions are at risk if the business cannot pay its debts.

The cooperative was formed by a group of local farmers and food producers who wanted to sell their products directly to consumers, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair wages for everyone involved.Currently, FairHarvest’s primary customers are local grocery stores, which stock their organic fruits and vegetables as part of their commitment to offering locally sourced goods. In addition to grocery stores, FairHarvest also sells products through a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program, local farmers' markets, and to nearby restaurants.Figure 1: Projected Sales Growth of Organic Products 2025-2030\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/c844a737-4b46-4c1d-8183-dfc68c67d122/images/473b7de3-b9d5-4927-b25f-b01252fb14f1/Screenshot%202025-07-21%20at%2012.08.13.JPEG)\n\nAs a cooperative, the members of FairHarvest benefit from shared profits, and the earnings are reinvested into the cooperative to fund new equipment, expand their farm operations, and support local community initiatives.

While all channels show consistent year-on-year growth, the data highlights that Farmers' Markets are projected to be the fastest-growing sales channel, significantly outpacing both Restaurants and Grocery Stores. This suggests that the cooperative's direct-to-consumer strategy, particularly through local markets, is expected to yield the highest returns and should likely be a focal point for future investment and resource allocation to capitalize on this strong growth trajectory.Mark allocation:Candidates are not expected to word their comment exactly as above.Award[1]for a basic explanation and an additional[1]for a full explanation of the candidate’s interpretation including direct reference to the data, up to a maximum of[2].Sample response:One challenge is the difficulty in making quick decisions due to the democratic decision-making process. While it allows all members to have an equal vote, this can slow down decision-making, especially when there is a conflict between younger and older members regarding the adoption of modern farming methods. Younger members may want to invest in new technology, but older members are resistant to change, which could create tension and delay important decisions for the cooperative’s future.Another challenge is competition from larger agricultural companies that benefit from economies of scale. Since FairHarvest is a smaller cooperative, they may struggle to match the prices and production output of larger, non-organic farming companies. This could limit their market share and impact profitability, especially if they continue to use more traditional farming methods that are less cost-efficient.Mark allocation:Award[1]for each challenge identified, up to a maximum of[2].Award[1]for each explanation applied to the case to a maximum of[2].Award a maximum of[4].",

The owner, Jawaher, is personally involved in every aspect of the business and had daily contact with customers, offering a warm, personalized experience. She was known for being quick to respond to customer feedback, often incorporating popular requests into the development of new soap varieties. This responsiveness helped PureBliss build a loyal local customer base.As PureBliss continues to grow in popularity, Jawaher is finding it increasingly difficult to manage the workload on her own. With rising demand and plans to expand the product range, she recognises the need for additional capital to support the next phase of growth. However, Jawaher is highly protective of the creative process and wants to ensure the brand’s unique identity remains intact.For this reason, she is considering taking on a silent partner. Jawaher has done her research on types of legal business structures, and believes this is the most suitable for her to grow her business.Definethe term silent partner.[2]Explaintwo advantages for Jawaher of setting up PureBliss as a sole trader.[4]Explaintwo disadvantages for Jawaher of taking on a silent partner.[4][Maximum 10]",

Their involvement is typically limited to their financial investment, and they often remain undisclosed to the public.Mark allocation:Award[1]for a definition that shows partial understanding.Award[2]for a definition that shows understanding similar to the answer above.No application is required.Sample response:As a sole trader, Jawaher had complete control over all decisions related to PureBliss. She could decide on product designs, pricing, suppliers, and marketing without needing approval from partners or shareholders. This allowed her to quickly respond to customer feedback and introduce new soap varieties based on popular demand, helping the business grow and build customer loyalty.Another major advantage is that Jawaher was entitled to keep all the profits the business made. Since there were no other owners at the beginning, she could reinvest earnings directly into PureBliss to expand the product range or improve the shop, supporting the growth of the business from a small local venture to a thriving operation.Mark allocation:Mark as 2 + 2Award[1]for each advantage identified and an additional[1]for application to the case study.Award a maximum of[4].Sample response:A drawback relevant to Jawaher is that the silent partner would not be involved in the day-to-day running of the business. While this means Jawaher retains creative control, it also means she would still be responsible for managing the growing workload on her own. If Jawaher's aim is to grow the business, this is likely to lead to increased stress and operational challenges.A second drawback is that Jawaher would have to share the business profits with the sleeping partner. Even though the partner is not involved in managing the business, they are still entitled to a portion of the earnings, which reduces Jawaher’s overall financial return from the success she built.Mark allocation:Mark as 2 + 2Award[1]for each drawback identified and an additional[1]for application to the case study.Award a maximum of[4].",

      "content": "GreenTech Innovations was originally a privately held company (LTD) focused on designing and manufacturing solar panels and renewable energy technologies. The company was founded with an environmentally-focused mission, committed to using sustainable materials and reducing carbon emissions. Initially, GreenTech raised capital through private investment and grants to support its operations.However, as the company expanded and sought additional funding to scale operations, GreenTech Innovations transitioned into a Publicly Held Company (PLC). The decision to become a  PLC was driven by the need to raise significant capital for research and development, and to expand production capacity.Since becoming a PLC, GreenTech Innovations has faced increasing pressure from investors to improve profitability and deliver short-term returns. Investors are demanding higher profits and faster growth, which has led to a shift in strategy. The company has faced growing tension between its initial mission of promoting green energy and the increasing pressure to invest in fossil fuel technologies.Table 1: GreenTech Innovations - Sector Performance & Customer Preference Trends (2025-2027)\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/97a1a29b-d093-40ef-83e4-f85964fd8e22/images/bc4ba3f7-79e2-428d-8a31-e60536a421b0/Screenshot%202025-07-25%20at%2007.26.40.JPEG)\n\n*YoY = year on yearSome shareholders are advocating for the company to diversify its portfolio by investing in oil and gas to generate higher profits, a move that conflicts with GreenTech’s founding environmental goals.Definethe term publicly held company.[2]With reference to GreenTech Innovations,explainone feature of a publicly held company (PLC).[2]Commenton the data in Table 1.[2]Explainone advantage and disadvantage for GreenTech Innovations of transitioning from an LTD to a PLC.[4][Maximum 10]",

Since becoming a PLC, GreenTech Innovations faces intense pressure from shareholders to deliver higher profits and short-term growth. This has created tension with the company’s original mission of promoting renewable energy, as some investors are pushing for diversification into oil and gas — industries that directly contradict its environmentally focused goals.

The ownership is confined to a smaller number of founders and investors. Shareholders can buy or sell shares only with the board of directors' approval.Publicly held companiescan raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) when a publicly held company first sells all or part of its shares to external investors. The company can sell shares to the public and generate finance for expansion or acquisitions.Privately held companieshave more limited options for raising capital. Their usual sources are loans from banks or financial institutions, private investments or retained earnings.Publicly held companiesare subject to stringent regulatory requirements imposed by government authorities, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) in Europe. Regulators strictly enforce compliance with corporate governing standards, accurate financial reporting and disclosure obligations.Privately held companiesface relatively fewer regulatory obligations. Their financial disclosures need not be as detailed as those of a publicly held company, and they have more flexibility in their corporate governance.A characteristic ofpublicly held companiesis a separation between the numerous owners and those who manage and run the company. Shareholders have voting rights, often in proportion to the size of their shareholding. The functionaries are elected and appointed through voting. In reality, shareholders have limited influence over operations.Privately held companieshave a more direct link between shareholders and control of the company.

They can achieve cost savings through large-scale provision of services such as defence, communication and public transport. Privately owned companies would not have that advantage and would struggle to operate profitably.Public sector companies play a vital role in safeguarding and promoting strategic national interests through operating companies involved in defence-related production, energy, communications and infrastructure development. The government can ensure national security and sovereignty by controlling essential resources and infrastructure. Governments must closely monitor and manage critical production facilities such as weapons and nuclear power for safety.Public sector companies have the advantage of financial stability through government backing. They can be involved in projects and services with very long gestation periods. These projects would not be financially attractive to private enterprises. Governments use wholly owned and controlled public sector companies, like banks and financial institutions, to interfere with and stabilise or give direction to the economic environment in the country.Governments, through private sector companies, are the largest employers in any country. Many teachers and medical professionals in any country work for government-owned institutions, as do employees in administrative, policing and defence forces. Public sector companies offer job security with a stable environment and significantly contribute to reducing unemployment.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each advantage of public sector companies.2 marksfor explaining each advantage of public sector companies.Total- 4 marks",

      "content": "EmpowHer Microfinance is a non-profit social enterprise that provides small loans to women in developing countries to help them start their own small businesses. These loans support women in sectors such as farming, retail, and craft production, giving them the opportunity to generate income, improve their families’ living standards, and become financially independent.Unlike traditional businesses, EmpowHer does not aim to make a profit for shareholders. Instead, all profits are reinvested into the organisation to fund more loans, expand its reach into new communities, and offer financial literacy and business training to its clients.As a non-profit, EmpowHer's management team is focused primarily on achieving its social mission rather than financial targets. While this allows them to prioritise helping women, it can sometimes make it harder to maintain strict financial controls or monitor efficiency in the same way a profit-driven business might.EmpowHer's mission is to reduce poverty and promote gender equality by empowering women through access to finance, education, and entrepreneurship opportunities.Statetwo features of a social enterprise.[2]Definethe term microfinance.[2]With reference to EmpowHer Microfinance,outlineone difference between a for-profit social enterprise and a non-profit social enterprise.[2]Describeone advantage and one disadvantage for EmpowHer operating as a nonprofit social enterprise.[4][Maximum 10]",

This allows EmpowerHer to prioritise helping women in developing countries through microfinance, education, and support, aligning all decisions with its core goal of reducing poverty and promoting gender equality.One disadvantage is that, as a non-profit, EmpowHer may face challenges in maintaining financial and cost control because there is less emphasis on generating profits and meeting financial targets. Without the same financial discipline seen in for-profit businesses, there is a risk of inefficiency or difficulties in sustaining operations long-term.Award[1]for a relevant advantage / disadvantage identified and an additional[1]for a relevant explanation of that advantage / disadvantage in the context of EmpowHer, up to a maximum of[2].Award a maximum of[4].",

The business operates a stylish coffee shop that serves ethically sourced coffee, baked goods, and light meals. What sets Second Chance Coffee apart is its mission: all its employees are either homeless or ex-prisoners, many of whom struggled to find stable employment.Lewis, a former social worker, launched the business to provide a supportive environment and help individuals reintegrate into society through employment, training, and mentorship. Although the coffee shop aims to make a profit, its social mission is at the heart of every decision. Lewis reinvests a portion of the profits into staff development and welfare programs.Despite a growing customer base, the business faces high training and support costs, and sometimes deals with challenges related to team management and social stigma. However, Lewis believes that combining social purpose with a strong brand is the key to long-term success.Definethe term social enterprise.[2]With reference to Second Chance Coffee,explainone feature of for-profit social enterprises.[2]Explainone reason why Lewis might have chosen to set up Second Chance Coffee as a for-profit social enterprise.[2]Explaintwo challenges Second Chance Coffee may face as a for-profit social enterprise.[4][Maximum 10]",

By choosing to set up Second Chance Coffee as a for-profit social enterprise, Lewis could apply this approach by generating income (profit) while supporting homeless people and ex-prisoners into employment (people).

Since all employees at Second Chance Coffee are homeless or ex-prisoners, Lewis must invest extra time and money into onboarding, skills development, and mentoring, which increases operational costs and affects short-term profitability.A second challenge is social stigma, where businesses must gain legitimacy in society.

      "content": "Cooperativa Esperanza is an agricultural cooperative made up of small-scale farmers in Guatemala. By working together, these farmers pool their resources to purchase supplies in bulk, share machinery, and access larger markets to better compete with bigger agricultural businesses.However, the cooperative faces several challenges. There are language and cultural barriers between members, which sometimes lead to miscommunication and difficulties in decision-making. Additionally, while the cooperative recognises the need to invest in more modern machinery to improve productivity, obtaining additional funding has proven difficult due to limited access to finance and for rural businesses.In the local area, it is common for children not to finish primary education, as many end up working on farmland alongside their parents to support the family’s income. A local non-governmental organization  (NGO) has approached Cooperativa Esperanza with an offer to provide training and access to more advanced farming methods and technology. The aim is to help improve agricultural productivity so that families rely less on child labour and children are given the opportunity to complete their schooling.Statetwo features of a cooperative.[2]Explainone advantage and one disadvantage for Cooperativa Esperanza of being a cooperative.[4]With reference to Cooperativa Esperanza,explaintwo objectives of NGOs.[4][Maximum 10]",

These investors buy the company's stock through open stock markets.Disclosure Requirements: Publicly held companies must comply with several regulatory and reporting requirements, including the regulation that financial statements and public disclosures be filed regularly.Access to Capital: Public-held companies can readily obtain capital by offering more shares of their stock for sale to the general public, which can then be exchanged on stock markets.Ownership Liquidity: Investors benefit from the ease with which shareholders of publicly held companies can purchase and sell their shares on the open market.Key feature ofPrivate Held Company:Ownership: The shares of privately held companies are not listed on a public exchange and are usually owned by a smaller group of investors, such as the founders, family and friends.Disclosure Requirements: Since privately held businesses are exempt from the duty to disclose their financial information to the public, they are subject to less regulatory reporting requirements than publicly held companies.Access to money: Because privately held companies rely on loans, retained earnings, or private investments for finance, their access to money may be more constrained.Control and Decision-Making: Because privately held companies have fewer shareholders and are subject to less public scrutiny, their owners typically have more control over the day-to-day operations and decision-making of the business.Sample response:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}Sample response:​Despite their apparent similarities, publicly traded and privately held companies differ significantly in several crucial areas. Shares of publicly held companies are owned by a wide range of individuals, including large and regular investors who trade their shares on the stock exchange. They must share financial reports and information with the public, which can be a lot of work, to keep everyone informed about how they're doing. This implies they have many owners who can purchase or sell their shares fast, but it also makes it easier for them to make money by selling additional shares to the general public.On the other hand, the number of owners in privately held companies is lower. Since they don't offer shares to the general public, the company is governed by a small group of friends or family. They enjoy more privacy because they are not required to disclose their financial information to the public as often. However, because individuals can't just sell stock market shares when they need money, finding it can be more difficult. Owners typically have greater authority over the business, and selling or buying an ownership stake is more complex. Consequently, even if both types of businesses operate, their policies and procedures differ.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each difference.2 marksfor explaining each difference.Total- 4 marks",

Therefore, partners are responsible for the company's debts, even if other partners encounter these.Decision-making: Decisions need to be made by the partners, which leads to a longer time for decisions to be made and agreed upon by all partners.Advantage 1:One advantage of being a partnership is the division of labour. Specialised work is possible since partners may focus on specific areas of the company and divide the company's tasks. With each partner focusing on specialised tasks, productivity and efficiency will likely improve, thus increasing profits and motivation.Advantage 2:A partnership will benefit from multiple owners investing in the company, leading to an increase in finance to set up and sustain the company. Also, setting up a partnership is simple, fast and inexpensive, an advantage of forming a partnership.Disadvantage 1:One disadvantage of being a partnership is having unlimited liability. With unlimited liability, all partners are responsible for the debts and legal issues encountered by the company, even if this is from one partner or if the company encounters a loss at some point. Therefore, partners must respond to the debts, which may affect their personal property if a debt is not paid out.Disadvantage 2:Disagreements in decision-making are disadvantages in partnerships; all of the members of a partnership need to agree on all decisions made before they are implemented.
