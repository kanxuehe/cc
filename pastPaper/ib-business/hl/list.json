    "content": "Ben’s Fika is a newly established Swedish coffee shop founded by 26-year-old entrepreneur, Ben Grahamson. Inspired by Sweden’s traditional coffee culture known as “ fika,” a social coffee break with pastries, Ben saw an opportunity to create a cozy, community focused space in central Stockholm.\nThe business sources local organic ingredients and specializes in traditional Swedish pastries, such as cinnamon buns and cardamom rolls. Initially, Ben operates as a sole trader and hires two part-time baristas. One of his staff members frequently proposes creative new pastry recipes and unique coffee blends to enhance the menu and customer experience. He plans to expand Ben’s Fika into a small chain within the next five years.\nBen faces challenges such as competition from large coffee chains, high rental costs in Stockholm, and the need to build brand loyalty from scratch. However, he sees opportunities in Sweden’s growing demand for artisanal and sustainable products and the increasing popularity of locally owned cafés.\n\n- State two industries that operate in the tertiary sector. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Distinguish one difference between an entrepreneur, like Ben, and an\nintrapreneur, using the context of Ben’s Fika. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain the sector in which Ben’s Fika operates. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Outline one characteristic of Ben that shows he is an entrepreneur. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain one challenge and one opportunity that Ben may face when starting up Ben’s Fika. <span class=\"marks\">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[Maximum 12]</span>\n",

No application needed.\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One key difference between an entrepreneur and an intrapreneur is that an entrepreneur, like Ben at Ben’s Fika, starts and owns the business, taking on financial risks and making major decisions independently. In contrast, an intrapreneur works within an existing organization and innovates by suggesting new ideas or products; for example, Ben’s staff member who frequently proposes creative new recipes does so as an employee, using the business’s resources without bearing the risks of ownership.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] if the candidate describes one clear difference between an entrepreneur and intrapreneur.\n- Award [1] for the difference being applied in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n\n\n\n- Additional information:\n- Key features of being an entrepreneur:\n- \n  - Entrepreneurs are individuals who take calculated risks and initiative in the start-up of a new business or project.\n\n- \n  - They manage, organize and plan resources needed for business activity.\n\n- \n  - They take the financial risk and exploit business opportunities in return for profit.\n\n- \n  - They often spot an opportunity to improve/change something in the business world.\n\n\n\n\n- Key features of being an intrapreneur:\n- \n  - Intrapreneurship concerns someone employed by a business to develop new ideas.\n\n- \n  - Intrapreneurs use entrepreneurial skills to innovate and drive positive change for a company, rather than starting a separate business.\nHowever, they usually do not take any personal financial risk.\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- Ben’s Fika operates in the tertiary sector, as it provides a service, selling coffee and pastries to customers, rather than producing raw materials or manufacturing goods.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1]  for identifying the sector correctly.\n- Award [1] for justification in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- Key features of the tertiary sector:\n- \n  - Businesses provide a service to customers, i.e. selling the finished products.\n\n- \n  - Examples of businesses in the tertiary sector include: coffee shops (retail industry), hotels and restaurants (hospitality industry), airlines and railways (transportation industry), banks (finance industry).\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- Ben is innovative because he identified an opportunity to bring traditional Swedish fika culture to a business setting by opening a café that focuses on community and local traditions.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1]  for identifying a characteristic of an entrepreneur.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- Key features of an entrepreneur include:\n- \n  - Innovative\n\n- \n  - Risk-taker\n\n- \n  - Visionary\n\n- \n  - Organized\n\n- \n  - Motivated\n\n- \n  - Resilient\n\n- \n  - Confident\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One challenge a new business faces as it tries to establish itself is intense existing competition. Ben's Fika must compete with large, established coffee chains in Stockholm. These chains have strong brand loyalty, large marketing budgets, and economies of scale, making it difficult for Ben's Fika to attract customers and cover high rental costs in a prime location.\n- One opportunity is a favourable external trend that could help the new business succeed, like changes in consumer preferences or gaps in the market. Ben can tap into Sweden's growing demand for artisanal, sustainable products and the popularity of locally owned cafés. By sourcing organic ingredients and focusing on traditional Swedish pastries, Ben's Fika can attract customers who prefer authentic, high-quality experiences over generic chain cafés.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1]  for identifying identifying a relevant challenge.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n- Award [1]  for identifying identifying a relevant opportunity.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of Ben’s Fika.\n\n\n\n- Additional information:\n- Challenges of starting a business:\n- \n  - Lack of finance: Difficulty securing sufficient capital or investment.\n\n- \n  - Cash flow problems: Irregular revenue makes it hard to cover operational costs.\n\n- \n  - Marketing challenges: Low brand recognition and limited promotional budgets.\n\n- \n  - Legal and administrative barriers: Complex regulations and paperwork can slow down operations.\n\n\n\n\n- Opportunities of starting a business:\n- \n  - Identifying a market gap: Meeting unmet customer needs with a unique product or service.\n\n- \n  - Innovation and creativity: Introducing new ideas, products, or business models to gain a competitive edge.\n\n- \n  - Flexibility and autonomy: Gaining independence by being your own boss and setting your own direction.\n\n- \n  - Potential for high earnings: Greater profit potential compared to being an employee, especially if the business scales.\n\n",

    "markScheme": "Four functional areas or departments in a business are Human Resource Management, Finance and Accounts, Marketing and Operations Management. For an organisation to be successful, each has to perform its role efficiently.\n\n- Human Resource Management is vital in procuring and managing the organisation's employees.\n- Finance and Accounts manage the organisation's money and ensure compliance with tax laws.\n- Marketing identifies customers' needs.\n- Operations Management is responsible for efficiently carrying out the organisation's core business.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nHuman Resource Management is vital in procuring and managing the employee bank. An efficient workforce is indispensable to a business if it is to be a financially viable enterprise. The human resource management team ensures a well-trained, motivated workforce. They plan ahead in keeping with the organisation's projected growth, are responsible for creating an efficient structure with decisive leadership and deal with industrial-employee relationships. Whether the business is a production or service, an efficient employee base is its most valuable asset, and this asset is managed by the human resource department.\nFinance and Accounts manage the organisation's money and ensure compliance with tax laws. Part of their function is ensuring sufficient cash flow without excess unused funds. This department keeps shareholders and senior management informed of the organisation's financial position.\nFinance and accounts are crucial in providing financial information and analysis to support decision-making. The department helps in efficient resource allocation and budgeting and safeguards the organisation's assets. Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is another important function.\nMarketing is a vital function. This department identifies customers' needs through market research and knowledge of the specific industry. The organisation then designs products to meet customer expectations, generating a higher market acceptance and sales volume. Every business needs sufficient sales of products or services to survive and be profitable.\nThe Operations Management department is responsible for efficiently carrying out the organisation's core business, whether it is production, retail or service. A well-managed production facility will produce quality goods on time, an enjoyable retail experience will gain a large customer base and grow, and a well-run service industry like a hotel or travel agency will gain a favourable reputation and have repeat customers. Efficient management of operations in any business creates goodwill for the organisation and ensures profitability and growth.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identification of each area.\n2 marks for explaining each area in detail.\nTotal - 4 marks",

    "markScheme": "A business is a decision-making organisation using inputs to produce goods or provide a service to make a profit.\n\n- Inputs are a business's resources to produce goods or services.\n- Outputs are the products.\n- Product (Goods or Services) - Goods are physical products, and services are intangible.\n- An entrepreneur is a person who plans, organises and manages a business.\n- Value addition is to enhance the value of a product by making it more valuable or desirable.\n- Needs are the basic necessities people must have for survival.\n- Wants are people's desires.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nInputs are the resources or factors of production used by a business to produce goods or services. These can include labour, raw materials, technology and capital. Efficient sourcing of resources is vital to the successful and profitable production of goods or services.\nOutputs are the goods or services a business generates to meet customers' needs or wants, using inputs and processing them to add value. The product or service can be for individual customers or other businesses, such as transportation, insurance, and information technology services.\nThe term product can refer to both goods or services. Goods, like cars, smartphones, and chocolates, are physical products that can be seen and touched. Services involve benefits or activities offered to customers without a physical product. These are intangible, like cloud computing services, education, or healthcare, and cannot be physically touched.\nAn entrepreneur is an individual who takes the initiative to plan, set up and operate a business, taking on the risks and responsibilities associated with business ownership. Successful entrepreneurs are creative, innovative and passionate about their chosen business area.\nValue addition is the process of enhancing the value of a product or service. Value addition for creating a positive difference between the production and selling costs of a product or service is the purpose and nature of a business. Value addition improves the quality, features, and desirability, making a product more attractive to customers and, therefore, able to command a higher price.\nIndividuals' needs are basic necessities for survival, such as food, shelter and clothing. These are things humans cannot do without.\nWants are people's desires beyond their basic needs and are things they want to own or experience. Wants are shaped by individual tastes and preferences and can include things like a larger home, expensive cars, exotic holidays, jewellery and luxury clothing.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying two key terms related to the concept of business (1 mark for each term).\n2 marks for explaining the terms in detail (1 mark for each detailed explanation).\nTotal - 4 marks",

Leila tapped into this market by offering pre-packaged, locally sourced meals, which combine health benefits and convenience, meeting the needs of health-conscious consumers looking for on-the-go options.\n- Another opportunity Leila identified was that her passion for food science and expertise in creating nutritious meals allowed her to offer a product that directly matched her skillset. Leila's personal interest in promoting healthy eating was an advantage, enabling her to create meals that not only catered to market demand but also reflected her commitment to nutritious living. This alignment made her passionate about the business and ensured she could consistently deliver high-quality products.\n- Mark as 2+2\n- Award [1] for each opportunity identified and an additonal [1] for application to the case.\n",

The members take pride in their work and enjoy a democratic approach to decision-making.\nDespite their success, the cooperative faces challenges such as managing supply and demand for their products and competing with larger, non-organic agricultural companies that have lower production costs\n\n- Define the term cooperative. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain one advantage for FairHarvest Cooperative of operating as a cooperative. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Comment on the data in Table 1. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain two challenges FairHarvest Cooperative may face as a cooperative. <span class=\"marks\">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[Maximum 10]</span>\n",

While it allows all members to have an equal vote, this can slow down decision-making, especially when there is a conflict between younger and older members regarding the adoption of modern farming methods. Younger members may want to invest in new technology, but older members are resistant to change, which could create tension and delay important decisions for the cooperative’s future.\n- Another challenge is competition from larger agricultural companies that benefit from economies of scale. Since FairHarvest is a smaller cooperative, they may struggle to match the prices and production output of larger, non-organic farming companies. This could limit their market share and impact profitability, especially if they continue to use more traditional farming methods that are less cost-efficient.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for each challenge identified, up to a maximum of [2].\n- Award [1] for each explanation applied to the case to a maximum of [2].\n- Award a maximum of [4].\n",

    "content": "GreenTech Innovations was originally a privately held company (LTD) focused on designing and manufacturing solar panels and renewable energy technologies. The company was founded with an environmentally-focused mission, committed to using sustainable materials and reducing carbon emissions. Initially, GreenTech raised capital through private investment and grants to support its operations.\nHowever, as the company expanded and sought additional funding to scale operations, GreenTech Innovations transitioned into a Publicly Held Company (PLC). The decision to become a  PLC was driven by the need to raise significant capital for research and development, and to expand production capacity.\nSince becoming a PLC, GreenTech Innovations has faced increasing pressure from investors to improve profitability and deliver short-term returns. Investors are demanding higher profits and faster growth, which has led to a shift in strategy.

The ownership is dispersed among numerous shareholders.\nA privately held company is owned by shareholders with limited liability, but its shares cannot be bought or sold by the general public on the stock exchange. The ownership is confined to a smaller number of founders and investors. Shareholders can buy or sell shares only with the board of directors' approval.\nPublicly held companies can raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) when a publicly held company first sells all or part of its shares to external investors. The company can sell shares to the public and generate finance for expansion or acquisitions.\nPrivately held companies have more limited options for raising capital. Their usual sources are loans from banks or financial institutions, private investments or retained earnings.\nPublicly held companies are subject to stringent regulatory requirements imposed by government authorities, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) in Europe. Regulators strictly enforce compliance with corporate governing standards, accurate financial reporting and disclosure obligations.\nPrivately held companies face relatively fewer regulatory obligations. Their financial disclosures need not be as detailed as those of a publicly held company, and they have more flexibility in their corporate governance.\nA characteristic of publicly held companies is a separation between the numerous owners and those who manage and run the company. Shareholders have voting rights, often in proportion to the size of their shareholding. The functionaries are elected and appointed through voting. In reality, shareholders have limited influence over operations.\nPrivately held companies have a more direct link between shareholders and control of the company.

These investors buy the company's stock through open stock markets.\n- Disclosure Requirements: Publicly held companies must comply with several regulatory and reporting requirements, including the regulation that financial statements and public disclosures be filed regularly.\n- Access to Capital: Public-held companies can readily obtain capital by offering more shares of their stock for sale to the general public, which can then be exchanged on stock markets.\n- Ownership Liquidity: Investors benefit from the ease with which shareholders of publicly held companies can purchase and sell their shares on the open market.\n\nKey feature of Private Held Company:\n\n- Ownership: The shares of privately held companies are not listed on a public exchange and are usually owned by a smaller group of investors, such as the founders, family and friends.\n- Disclosure Requirements: Since privately held businesses are exempt from the duty to disclose their financial information to the public, they are subject to less regulatory reporting requirements than publicly held companies.\n- Access to money: Because privately held companies rely on loans, retained earnings, or private investments for finance, their access to money may be more constrained.\n- Control and Decision-Making: Because privately held companies have fewer shareholders and are subject to less public scrutiny, their owners typically have more control over the day-to-day operations and decision-making of the business.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nDespite their apparent similarities, publicly traded and privately held companies differ significantly in several crucial areas. Shares of publicly held companies are owned by a wide range of individuals, including large and regular investors who trade their shares on the stock exchange. They must share financial reports and information with the public, which can be a lot of work, to keep everyone informed about how they're doing. This implies they have many owners who can purchase or sell their shares fast, but it also makes it easier for them to make money by selling additional shares to the general public.\nOn the other hand, the number of owners in privately held companies is lower. Since they don't offer shares to the general public, the company is governed by a small group of friends or family. They enjoy more privacy because they are not required to disclose their financial information to the public as often. However, because individuals can't just sell stock market shares when they need money, finding it can be more difficult. Owners typically have greater authority over the business, and selling or buying an ownership stake is more complex. Consequently, even if both types of businesses operate, their policies and procedures differ.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

This additional funding could be used to scale up ethical production processes or invest in sustainable technologies to help the business grow into a full-scale ethical fashion brand.\n- Another benefit is that it boosts the reputation of Sole Revival, which could lead to developing long-term partnerships, such as with eco-conscious fashion retailers or sustainable material suppliers. Building long-term partnerships with such organizations would help Roh expand her distribution channels and secure a reliable supply chain, supporting her goal of becoming a full-scale ethical fashion brand.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1]  for identifying one advantage of converting to a privately held company.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of supporting Sole Revivals aim of becoming a full scale ethical brand.\n- Award [1] for identifying a second advantage of converting to a privately held company.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of supporting Sole Revivals aim of becoming a full scale ethical brand.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- \n  - In a privately held company, shares cannot be bought by the general public on the stock market.\n\n- \n  - Instead, shares are typically bought by the business owner, friends and family and private investors, such as business angels or venture capitalists.\n\n- \n  - These shareholders are usually invited or approved by the company's existing owners or board, and transferring shares without permission is often restricted.\n\n",

    "markScheme": "Sole trader (Proprietorship):\n\n- Ownership and Legal Structure: Owned and operated by a single individual.\n- Liability: The owner has unlimited personal liability. Sole traders are unincorporated businesses, meaning the owners have the same legal identity as the business.\n- Management and Decision-making: The owner has complete control over operations and decision-making.\n- Capital and Funding: Capital is usually contributed by the owner personally.\n- Continuity and Succession: Business continuity is tied to the owner's lifespan and willingness to continue.\n- Regulatory Compliance and Reporting: Fewer regulatory and reporting requirements.\n\nPrivate-Held Company:\n\n- Ownership and Legal Structure: Owned by a limited number of shareholders.\n- Liability: Shareholders have limited personal liability. Privately-held companies are incorporated businesses, meaning the owners have a separate legal identity from the business.\n- Management and Decision-making: Management and decision-making may be shared or delegated to a board of directors.\n- Capital and Funding: Diverse options include shareholder investments, loans, and venture capital.\n- Continuity and Succession: More structured succession plans can be in place.\n- Regulatory Compliance and Reporting: More regulatory and reporting requirements than a sole trader.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nThe most basic type of business entity is a sole trader (proprietorship), which is distinguished by its simplicity and single ownership structure. A single person with total authority over the company's management and decision-making processes owns and runs the company. The owner puts their assets at risk in the event of financial losses by taking on limitless personal accountability for all corporate debts and commitments. Sole traders are unincorporated businesses, meaning the owners have the same legal identity as the business.\nOn the other hand, a private-held firm is a more complicated business owned by a small number of shareholders. Shares are sold to private family and friends. Privately-held companies are incorporated businesses, meaning the owners have a separate legal identity from the business. A broader capital base and various funding choices, such as shareholder investments, loans, venture capital, or joint ventures with other companies, are possible. Limited personal liability protects shareholders' assets from business debts in a privately held corporation. Shares can only be bought and sold with prior approval from the Board of Directors.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

    "content": "Explain one advantage and disadvantage of a partnership. <span class=\"marks\">[4]</span>\n",
    "markScheme": "Advantages of being a partnership:\n\n- Finance: Multiple owners invest in the company with a simple and inexpensive set-up.\n- Specialised partners: Division of labour is possible as partners may specialise in specific company areas, improving productivity and efficiency.\n- Privacy: Partnerships do not publish their financial records.\n\nDisadvantages of being a partnership:\n\n- Continuity: When a partner leaves the partnership or passes away, the partnership needs to be completely set up again; this leads to a lack of continuity.\n- Liability: Partnerships have unlimited liability. Therefore, partners are responsible for the company's debts, even if other partners encounter these.\n- Decision-making: Decisions need to be made by the partners, which leads to a longer time for decisions to be made and agreed upon by all partners.\n\nAdvantage 1:\nOne advantage of being a partnership is the division of labour. Specialised work is possible since partners may focus on specific areas of the company and divide the company's tasks. With each partner focusing on specialised tasks, productivity and efficiency will likely improve, thus increasing profits and motivation.\nAdvantage 2:\nA partnership will benefit from multiple owners investing in the company, leading to an increase in finance to set up and sustain the company. Also, setting up a partnership is simple, fast and inexpensive, an advantage of forming a partnership.\nDisadvantage 1:\nOne disadvantage of being a partnership is having unlimited liability. With unlimited liability, all partners are responsible for the debts and legal issues encountered by the company, even if this is from one partner or if the company encounters a loss at some point. Therefore, partners must respond to the debts, which may affect their personal property if a debt is not paid out.\nDisadvantage 2:\nDisagreements in decision-making are disadvantages in partnerships; all of the members of a partnership need to agree on all decisions made before they are implemented. This will slow down the decision-making process, even if some of those decisions must be made fast, creating a communication problem and affecting the company's efficiency. This could also create a problem if not all partners agree.",

A mission statement is a nearer-term goal.\n- Scope: A vision is abstract, whereas a mission statement is more specific.\n- Inspiration, Execution: Vision statements are designed to inspire and motivate. A mission statement focuses on the execution of purpose.\n- Consistency, change: A vision statement is long-term and enduring. An organisation might adjust its mission statement from time to time.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nA vision statement outlines an organisation's aspirations and long-term goals. It is a reflection of where it would like to position itself in the distant future and a preview of what the company envisions its success should look like. A vision statement gives a general direction to an organisation's intended goal.\nA mission statement is more focused on the present. It is a declaration of the fundamental purpose of an organisation's existence and its core values.\nA vision statement is inspirational and usually abstract. The statement is not about targets that need to be achieved but projects a vision of what can be accomplished. A vision statement inspires and binds the employees, owners and stakeholders together.\nA mission statement is specific and action-oriented. It outlines the principles of the organisation and sets a framework for how managers and employees operate to achieve its goals.\nA vision statement is inspirational and motivates employees and stakeholders by creating an environment of unity and commitment through a shared sense of purpose and direction.\nA mission statement is about the organisation's actions and focuses on execution during daily operations. It outlines the action to achieve its objectives and guides the decision-making process. A mission statement, though qualitative, should be clearly defined and achievable.\nA characteristic of vision statements is that they are stable and relevant in the long term. They can be refined from time to time, but the core message is consistent with the timeless values and goals of the organisation.\nOn the other hand, a mission statement is frequently adjusted to suit changes in the business environment, including market conditions and trends. An organisation's priorities can change over time, and the mission statement needs to be adjusted to remain relevant.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

    "markScheme": "Aims: Aims are the broad, general, and long-term goals a business aspires to achieve. They provide a sense of direction and purpose but are not specific or measurable.\nObjectives: Objectives are specific, measurable, and time-bound targets that a business sets to achieve its aims. They are more detailed and actionable.\nBelow are some key differences of Aims and Objectives:\nAims\n\n- Aims are usually open-ended and do not have specific details or deadlines attached to them.\n- Aims are not easily measurable since they are broad and qualitative.\n- Aims often have an indefinite or long-term time frame and may not have a fixed deadline.\n- Aims encompass the overall vision and purpose of the business and may involve multiple aspects of the organisation.\n- Aims provide the overarching vision and strategic direction, helping to align the organisation's efforts.\n- An aim for a business might be to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$become a market leader in the industry$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ without specifying how or when.\n- Aims set the overall direction and purpose for the business but, on their own, do not ensure success.\n\nObjectives\n\n- Objectives are highly specific and have clear criteria, such as deadlines, quantities, or percentages.\n- Objectives are measurable because they are defined with specific, quantifiable criteria that allow progress tracking.\n- Objectives have a defined time frame, typically short- to medium-term, and are time-bound.\n- Objectives are more focused and deal with particular aspects or functions of the business.\n- Objectives serve as actionable steps toward realising the aims and are critical for strategic planning and decision-making.\n- Objectives related to the above aim could include $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$increase market share by $10\\%$ within the next two years$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ or $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$launch a new product line by the end of the fiscal year.$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$\n- Objectives are the actionable steps that, when achieved, contribute directly to the business's success by fulfilling the aims.\n\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}$:\nAims and objectives represent two fundamental components in the strategic planning of a business. Aims, the broader and more abstract of the two, serve as the overarching vision and long-term goals of the organisation. They provide a sense of direction and purpose, helping to align the efforts of the business towards a common goal. However, it's essential to recognise that aims lack specificity and measurability. These goals are often open-ended, lacking specific details or deadlines. For instance, an aim for a business might be the ambition to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$become a market leader in the industry.$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ While this is undoubtedly a big aspiration that provides a sense of direction, it does not contain the specific criteria necessary for measurement, nor does it stipulate a deadline for its achievement.\nIn contrast, objectives are the practical, specific, and measurable steps that a business puts in place to realise its aims. Objectives are designed to be actionable and serve as the bridge between the broad aspirations encapsulated in aims and the practical implementation required for success. These objectives are characterised by their high level of specificity and measurability. For example, if the aim is to become a market leader, objectives may include $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$increase market share by 10% within the next two years$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ or $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$launch a new product line by the end of the fiscal year.$\\text{\\textquotedblright}$ Objectives are often set with clear criteria, such as deadlines, quantities, or percentages, making it possible to track progress and determine success.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

The company was founded by Emma Collins in 2015 with the mission of reducing environmental waste by using 100% recycled materials and sustainable wood sources. The business has grown steadily, focusing on providing stylish, durable furniture made from sustainably sourced materials, aiming to offer an environmentally responsible alternative to traditional furniture manufacturers.\nAs the company looks to expand into new markets and meet the growing demand for eco-friendly products, Emma and her team are developing a set of business objectives to guide their growth. They want to increase their market share in the furniture industry, with a focus on expanding into international markets within the next 5 years. EcoFurniture Co. is also focusing on improving operational efficiency by streamlining production processes and enhancing supply chain management.\nIn addition, EcoFurniture Co. is committed to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and has integrated sustainability goals into its business model. The company aims to become a carbon-neutral company by 2030 and is already taking steps toward this objective.\nEcoFurniture Co. has partnered with certified suppliers who provide locally sourced, sustainable wood and recycled materials, ensuring that their production processes align with their environmental goals. The company is actively involved in community tree planting programs and works with local organizations to reduce its carbon footprint through these green initiatives. Additionally, EcoFurniture Co. has adopted a zero-waste policy in its manufacturing process, recycling or repurposing all by-products and waste materials.\nHowever, despite these efforts, EcoFurniture Co. is finding it difficult to source 100% of its wood sustainably, as the demand for sustainable wood often exceeds supply, and there are challenges in finding consistent, certified sources.\n\n- State two features of a privately held company. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- With reference to EcoFurniture, outline what is meant by the term strategic objective. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- With reference to EcoFurniture, describe what is meant by the term tactical objective. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain two ways EcoFurniture is meeting its CSR goals and one way it is not. <span class=\"marks\">[6]</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[Maximum 12]</span>\n",

By engaging in these activities, EcoFurniture Co. is fulfilling its environmental responsibilities and promoting sustainability in the local community.\n- Despite these efforts, EcoFurniture Co. is finding it difficult to source 100% of its wood sustainably. The demand for certified sustainable wood often exceeds the supply, and EcoFurniture Co. has faced challenges in finding a consistent source of sustainable wood. As a result, the company is not yet fully meeting its CSR objective of using 100% sustainable materials, which remains a challenge for their environmental goals.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Mark as 2 + [2 + 2]\n- Award [1] for identifying a way that EcoFurniture is meeting its CSR goals and an additional [1] for explaining it up to a maximum of [2].\n- For each way in which EcoFurniture is meeting its CSR goals mark as 2 + 2.\n- Award [1] for identifying a way that EcoFurniture is not is meeting its CSR goals and an additional [1] for explaining it up to a maximum of [2].\n- Award a maximum of [6].\n",

However, suppliers generally prefer shorter payment terms, as it helps them maintain a consistent cash flow.\n- Quality vs Cost: Shareholders may focus on cost control and profitability, often pushing for lower-priced materials or services. Suppliers, on the other hand, may emphasise the importance of maintaining the quality of goods or services provided.\n- Supply Chain Reliability: Shareholders may seek to diversify the supply chain to mitigate risk, potentially by engaging multiple suppliers. Suppliers, however, prefer exclusivity and consistent orders.\n- Contract Negotiations: Shareholders may expect aggressive contract negotiations with suppliers to secure favourable terms for the company. Suppliers may view these negotiations as overly demanding or unfair, potentially harming their relationship with the company and affecting future cooperation.\n- Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals: Shareholders often have a vested interest in the company's stock performance in the short term. This may lead to a focus on immediate cost reduction, which can conflict with a supplier's perspective that prioritises building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}$:\nShareholders often seek to maximise profits and returns on their investments in the company. This objective may lead them to desire cost-cutting measures, which could include pressuring the management to negotiate lower prices with suppliers. On the other hand, suppliers aim to maintain their revenue and profit margins. Thus, when shareholders push for reduced costs, it can put suppliers in a difficult position, as they may need to make concessions that impact their own profitability.\nShareholders like longer payment terms when the company owes money because this means the company can hold onto its cash for a longer period. Holding onto cash can improve the company's financial position and give it more flexibility. When the company has more cash on hand, it appears healthier and more stable.\nOn the other hand, suppliers prefer shorter payment terms when they sell something. They want to get paid quickly because it ensures they have a steady inflow of cash. This consistent cash inflow is crucial for them to manage their own expenses and keep their operations running smoothly.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each reason.\n2 marks for explaining each reason.\nTotal - 4 marks",

From another point of view, an increase in employees' pay could improve employee motivation, and thus increase productivity and efficiency in the company, leading to an increase in profits and as a result an increase in the value of the company’s shares.",

Therefore, they have reasons to be concerned about its performance since they invest in a business with the sole objective of profit-making.\n\n- Dividend Yield: A dividend is the part of a company's annual earnings distributed to its shareholders.\n- Capital Appreciation: Capital appreciation through a positive difference in the share purchase price and the current listed price is another form of profit for shareholders in a company.\n- Long-term Competitiveness: Shareholders are interested in the long-term competitiveness of the company they have invested in to ensure their investment will continue to produce a favourable rate of return through dividends and share price appreciation.\n- Management and Governance: Shareholders are concerned with management and governance as these impact a company's profitability and share prices.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nA dividend is a portion of a company's annual earnings distributed to its shareholders. The board of directors decides the size of the dividend, which can be in the form of cash or reinvestment in the form of additional stock.\nShareholders are concerned about the company's performance since the size of the dividend is in proportion to its earnings. Investors monitor performance indicators and study financial results to ensure they get a good return on their investment.\nOther than dividends, growth in the value of shares through a positive difference in the share purchase price and the current listed price is another form of profit for shareholders in a company. The value of shares increases if a company's performance is financially favourable. Conversely, the value of shares can fall below the purchase price if the financial performance is not up to expectations.\nApart from a company's financial results and fundamentals, market sentiment significantly impacts share prices. The market sentiment may be related to factors affecting a company's reputation, general economic trends or news which affect the company's future performance.\nShareholders are concerned about the value of their investment.

    "content": "Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of external growth. <span class=\"marks\">[4]</span>\n",
    "markScheme": "External growth can have advantages as well as disadvantages.\nAdvantages:\n\n- Quicker to implement: External growth is a faster way to grow compared to internal growth.\n- The benefit of synergies: Combining two organisations can bring benefits of a greater talent pool.\n- Economies of scale: External growth can give access to a larger market, creating better economies of scale.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nQuicker to implement: External growth strategies, such as mergers and acquisitions, can be implemented relatively quickly compared to the slower, more organic internal growth process. For instance, acquiring a company immediately increases the acquiring company's size, market share, and resources. This rapid expansion is particularly advantageous in fast-moving industries or when a company must adjust quickly to market changes. It's also a quick way to access new technologies, products, or markets without the time and resources needed to develop them internally.\nEconomies of scale refer to the cost advantages a business obtains due to expansion. As the scale of operation increases, the cost per production unit typically decreases. Here's how external growth can enhance economies of scale:\n\n- Increased Production: By acquiring or merging with another company, a business can increase its production capacity, leading to lower costs per unit due to the spread of fixed costs over a larger output.\n- Purchasing Power: Larger organisations often have greater bargaining power with suppliers, which can lead to reduced costs for raw materials and other inputs.\n- Market Access: Expanding into new markets (geographical or product markets) can increase the customer base, spreading the fixed costs of operations over a more extensive revenue base, thus reducing the average cost.\nThis can result in more competitive pricing, higher margins, or both, which are crucial for long-term business sustainability and market competitiveness.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n- Higher cost: External growth costs more than internal growth.\n- Greater risk: The uncertainties of external growth translate to more significant risks.\n- Culture clash: Combining two organisations can result in a culture clash.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nHigher cost: External growth comes with a high price tag. Acquisition of another organisation requires interest-bearing finance. The price for the acquisition might be high, with shareholders taking advantage and demanding a higher-than-fair price.\nGreater risk: External growth, such as mergers and acquisitions, carries greater risk due to the complexities of integrating different organisational cultures, systems, and processes. This can lead to operational disruptions and employee dissatisfaction. Additionally, the significant financial investment required for external growth poses a risk if the anticipated benefits and synergies still need to be fully realised. These challenges, coupled with potential regulatory hurdles and stakeholder resistance, make external growth a riskier strategy than internal growth's more controlled and incremental approach.\nCulture clash: Two organisations coming together during the process of external growth can experience a cultural clash due to the difference in governance and management styles. While this can be eventually resolved, the resulting conflict can result from inefficient operations and decisions, causing tangible financial losses and a dissatisfied customer base.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each advantage and disadvantage.\n2 marks for explaining each advantage and disadvantage..\nTotal - 4 marks",

As a result, businesses are often less at risk of failing in a certain area of their operations.\n\nDisadvantages of external growth\n\n- More expensive than internal growth $\\text{\\textemdash}$ External growth strategies, including mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and franchising, are typically more expensive.\n- Greater risks are created by inadequate market information and the increased unpredictability of external growth.\n- Regulatory hurdles $\\text{\\textemdash}$ Governments may obstruct external growth, such as acquisitions and takeovers, if the action is considered anti-competitive.\n- Potential diseconomies of scale $\\text{\\textemdash}$ Increasing internal growth complexity can also result in inefficiencies and a consequent increase in average costs.\n- Organisational culture conflict $\\text{\\textemdash}$ It can be challenging to blend several cultures and management philosophies, particularly when external growth changes a company's character and culture.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nThe speed of external growth is one of its main benefits. External growth uses external resources and funds instead of organic growth, which depends on internal resources and labour-intensive development. This frequently causes the business to expand and diversify considerably more quickly. A privately held company can easily access new markets, clientele, and technology through mergers and acquisitions (M&As), joint ventures, strategic alliances, or franchising. This acceleration might give the privately held company a competitive advantage, especially in fast-paced industries where getting products to market quickly is critical.\nOn the other hand, external expansion tactics have some significant drawbacks, with cost being the main issue. M&As, joint ventures, and other external growth strategies are often more expensive than organic ones. Legal fees, transaction charges, integration costs, and the cost of buying already-existing assets or businesses may all be included in the costs. Furthermore, external development frequently involves a learning curve resulting in unanticipated operational or cultural difficulties. A privately held company's resources may be taxed by the costs and complications of external growth, necessitating careful planning, investigation, and risk management. For external expansion initiatives to be in line with the overall goals and long-term viability of the organisation, it is critical to strike a balance between expediency and financial ramifications.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each impact of growing externally for a privately held company.\n2 marks for explaining each impact of growing externally for a privately held company.\nTotal - 4 marks",

    "markScheme": "\n- Economies of Scale:\nCompanies aim to achieve economies of scale to enhance their growth prospects. This goal is driven by the desire to reduce average production costs as production volumes increase.\n\nThere are various types of economies of scale, categorised as internal and external economies of scale.\nInternal Economies of Scale\nInternal economies of scale involve adopting new technologies to enhance productivity, accessing financing at lower interest rates, employing specialised staff to improve output quality and volume, spreading advertising costs over larger production quantities, and procuring inventory in bulk at reduced rates.\nExternal Economies of Scale\nExternal economies of scale arise when a company gains access to new customer segments. For instance, an e-commerce business can significantly expand its customer base. Another example is when a company operates in an area with skilled workers, leading to lower recruitment and training expenses, thereby enhancing productivity and efficiency.\n\n- Diseconomies of Scale\nAs companies expand, their production capacity grows. However, if a company fails to operate close to its capacity, average costs and unit costs may rise, resulting in diseconomies of scale.\n\nDiseconomies of scale can be further categorized as internal and external.\nInternal Diseconomies of Scale\nInternal diseconomies of scale often arise due to communication challenges, demotivation among staff from repetitive tasks and increased workloads, bureaucratic hurdles, and slower decision-making processes stemming from larger hierarchical structures, all of which can directly impact production levels.\nExternal Diseconomies of Scale\nExternal diseconomies of scale occur when fixed costs escalate, including larger building rents due to increased production volumes and higher wages to retain skilled employees amidst increased job opportunities.",

    "markScheme": "Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages a business can achieve as it increases the scale of its production or operations.\nDiseconomies of scale is a situation in which a business experiences an increase in average costs as it continues to expand its production or operations.\nKey factors of economies of scale\n\n- Cost reduction: As operations' scale grows, economies of scale cause a decline in the mean production costs.\n- Efficiency: Greater production volumes result in increased resource utilisation and operational efficiency.\n- Competitive advantage: Achieving economies of scale can give a business the upper hand by enabling it to offer items at cheaper costs or of higher quality.\n- Investment in technology: Scale economies are frequently fueled by the application of cutting-edge technology and automation.\n- Specialisation: As production rises, cost savings from the specialisation of labour and resources are possible.\n- Lower manufacturing costs per unit: Lower manufacturing costs per unit translate into larger profit margins for the company.\n\nKey factors of diseconomies of scale\n\n- Cost increase: As activities continue to expand in scope, diseconomies of scale cause an increase in average production costs.\n- Efficiency issues: Managing a larger organisation may bring about efficiency issues, such as communication problems and coordination issues.\n- Complexity: As a business grows, it can become more difficult to run, which would raise administrative and operating costs.\n- Bureaucracy: More bureaucratic structures are frequently developed by larger organisations, which can impede efficiency and slow decision-making.\n- Staff morale: Due to decreased job satisfaction and a perception of being cut off from the organisation's goals, scale inefficiencies can have a detrimental impact on staff morale.\n- Adaptability: As organisations grow bigger, it is possible that they lose some of their ability to modify and respond to market demand changes.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}$\nAs a company grows and changes in size and production volume, economies of scale and diseconomies of scale reflect two separate stages in the development of a corporation. Economies of scale, a crucial stage of growth, are identified by a number of distinctive characteristics. The most notable aspect is cost reduction$\\text{\\textemdash}$average manufacturing costs fall as operations' scale increases. This is a result of improved economies of scale-driven operational efficiencies, more effective resource utilisation, and reduced per-unit manufacturing costs. A business can offer items at more competitive pricing or of higher quality thanks to economies of scale, giving it a competitive edge and improving its market position and profitability.\nIn contrast, certain crucial elements are at play when a corporation encounters diseconomies of scale. The development of increasingly complex and bureaucratic systems in larger organisations is one of the key contributing reasons. These frameworks may inhibit decision-making and impede efficiency, which limits adaptation.\nAnother crucial element related to diseconomies of scale is adaptability. Organisations may become less able to respond to shifting consumer demands as they get bigger. It may be difficult to quickly pivot or modify tactics due to the growing complexity of operations and decision-making processes. The key distinctions between economies and diseconomies of scale highlight how crucial effective management and strategic decision-making are as a firm grows, as well as the careful balancing act needed to maximise benefits while minimising costs.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each difference.\n2 marks for explaining each difference.\nTotal - 4 marks",

    "content": "PadelPro Systems is a Spain-based company founded in 2021 that designs and installs high-quality padel courts. Padel is a racket sport that blends elements of tennis and squash, and it is expanding rapidly worldwide—an opportunity the founders of PadelPro recognized early, leading them to enter the market with innovative court solutions.\nThe company serves luxury resorts, fitness centers, and publicly funded sports facilities across Europe and the Middle East. It uses customisable, weather-resistant courts built with sustainably sourced materials. In 2024, PadelPro installed over 150 courts and earned €2.3 million in revenue.\nPadelPro offers end-to-end services, including design, installation, and maintenance. It benefits from economies of scale by purchasing materials in bulk, reducing costs while maintaining quality.\nTo support international growth, PadelPro merged with a German sports construction firm and plans to expand into the U.S. market through partnerships with franchises.\n\n- Define the external growth method franchising. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Outline one difference between internal and external growth, with reference to PadelPro Systems.  <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain two reasons why PadelPro Systems might want to grow. <span class=\"marks\">[4]</span>\n\n- Explain two reasons why PadelPro chose a merger as a method of external growth. <span class=\"marks\">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[Maximum 12]</span>\n",
    "markScheme": "\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- Franchising is a legal agreement where the franchisor, the original business,  allows a franchisee, an individual or business, to operate using its brand, products, and processes in exchange for fees and royalty payments.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for a basic definition of franchising, which lacks detail.\n- Award [2] for a clear and accurate definition, showing understanding of both franchisor and franchisee roles.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- \n  - Franchising is a common method of external growth that allows rapid market expansion with lower financial risk for the franchisor.\n\n- \n  - For example, PadelPro Systems plans to expand into the U.S. market through partnerships with franchises, PadelPro would act as the franchisor.\n\n- \n  - PadelPro Systems, based in Spain, owns the brand, designs, and technical knowledge. They would grant selected U.S. based individuals or businesses (the franchisees) the right to operate under the PadelProSystems brand.\n\n- \n  - The franchisees operating local businesses in the U.S. would market and install PadelPro Systems courts in the U.S. They would also benefit from training and support provided by PadelPro Systems.\n\n- \n  - In the process PadelPro Systems expands its presence and earns income without opening and managing physical offices or hiring U.S. staff directly. It gains brand recognition, revenue streams from fees/royalties and market knowledge from local partners.\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- Internal growth occurs organically using the businesses own resources, such as increasing output. For example, PadelPro Systems expanded their output to install 150 padel courts whereas external growth involves merging with another company, as PadelPro did with a German firm.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for outlining a clear difference between internal and external growth.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- Examples of Internal growth (organic growth) include:\n- \n  - Increasing output or sales.\n\n- \n  - Launching new products.\n\n- \n  - Entering new markets independently.\n\n- \n  - Investing in new technology or facilities.\n\n\n\n\n- Examples of external growth (Inorganic growth) include:\n- \n  - Mergers.and acquisitions (M&As).\n\n- \n  - Takeovers.\n\n- \n  - Strategic alliances.\n\n- \n  - Joint ventures.\n\n- \n  - Franchising.\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One reason for PadelPro Systems to grow is to increase their market share, especially as demand for padel courts rises globally.  By expanding into new markets early, PadelPro can attract more clients and establish itself as a leading provider before competitors gain traction.\n- A second reason for PadelPro Systems to grow is to achieve cost savings through economies of scale. As PadelPro grows and installs more courts across Europe and the Middle East, it can buy materials in bulk and streamline their operations, reducing average costs and increasing their profit margins.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for identifying one reason to grow.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Award [1] for identifying a second reason to grow.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- The advantages of being a small business include:\n- \n  - Lower operating costs incurred so less cash flow issues.\n\n- \n  - Easier communication between employees.\n\n- \n  - Customised services to individual customer's preferences.\n\n- \n  - Less competition in the small businesses.\n\n\n\n\n- The advantages of being a large businesses include:\n- \n  - Access to a highly skilled and experienced workforce due to greater recruitment resources.\n\n- \n  - Strong brand recognition, leading to customer loyalty and market trust.\n\n- \n  - Greater financial capacity to invest in research and development (R&D) for innovation.\n\n- \n  - Larger market share, contributing to higher sales revenue and potential economies of scale.\n\n\n\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One reason to merge with a German construction firm is to expand geographically. By partnering with a company already established in Germany, PadelPro can benefit from the local firm’s existing customer base and supplier networks. This reduces the costs and risks associated with entering a foreign market alone and allows them to access new clients, such as sports clubs and luxury resorts more efficiently than through internal (organic) growth.\n- A second reason to merge with a German construction firm is to achieve synergies by sharing technical expertise and Research & Development costs for new padel court technologies. As a result, collaboration on innovation can accelerate the development of advanced, weather-resistant court designs, providing a clear competitive advantage.\n- Mark allocation:\n- Award [1] for identifying one reason to merge.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Award [1] for identifying a second reason to merge.\n- Award [1] for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.\n- Additional information:\n\n\n\n- Further advantages of Mergers are:\n- \n  - Economies of scale. Reduced average costs are achieved through bulk buying, shared operations, and combined infrastructure.\n\n- \n  - Diversification. Merging with a different but related business reduces risk across markets or product lines.\n\n",

    "content": "Pure Essence, founded by Nina and Samir in the London suburbs, is renowned for its organic, herbal, and chemical-free beauty products. Its recently released aloe vera moisturiser became a bestseller, attracting attention from department stores seeking to purchase it in bulk.\nWhile excited about the potential for increased revenue, Pure Essence faces challenges in scaling up, including hiring more staff, acquiring additional raw materials and equipment, and renting extra storage space. Personal savings have been heavily invested, and high interest rates on small business loans present a significant financial challenge.\nRecently, Pure Essence has been approached about a joint venture with a leading animal rights group, which Nina and Samir are very enthusiastic about. However, they are concerned that they currently lack the capacity to dedicate staff or resources to the venture due to the existing pressures of expansion and limited financial flexibility.\n\n- State two economies of scale Pure Essence is benefiting from. <span class=\"marks\">[2]</span>\n\n- Explain the difference between internal and external growth at Pure Essence. <span class=\"marks\">[4]</span>\n\n- Explain one reason why Pure Essence should enter the joint venture and one reason it should not. <span class=\"marks\">[4]</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[Maximum 10]</span>\n",

For Pure Essence, this includes hiring more staff, acquiring additional raw materials and equipment, and renting extra storage space to increase production of popular products like the aloe vera moisturiser.\n  External growth, on the other hand, involves a business expanding through partnerships or collaborations with other organisations. Pure Essence's possible joint venture with a leading animal rights group would be an example of external growth because they would be working with an outside organisation that is not part of the business.\n  Mark allocation:\n  Award [1] for stating the concept of internal growth.\nAward [1] for explaining internal growth with application to Pure Essence.\nAward [1] for stating the concept of external growth.\nAward [1] for explaining external growth with application to Pure Essence.\nUp to a maximum of [4].\n- Sample response:\n\n\n\n- One reason a business should consider entering a joint venture is that it could enhance business growth by expanding market reach and improving brand image. Partnering with a respected animal rights organisation can significantly strengthen Pure Essence’s ethical image and cruelty-free credentials. This association appeals to the growing segment of consumers who value animal welfare and ethical production and builds greater customer trust and loyalty.\n- One reason a business should not enter a joint venture is the challenge of managing limited resources during rapid expansion. Small businesses often face difficulties scaling operations due to staff, finances, and infrastructure constraints, which can hinder their ability to take on additional commitments. For Pure Essence, its current pressures from scaling up - such as hiring more staff, acquiring equipment, and high-interest loan repayments - mean it lacks the capacity and financial flexibility to allocate resources to the joint venture.\n\n\n\n- Mark allocation:\n- Mark as 2 + 2\n- Award [1] for a relevant advantage/disadvantage of a joint venture as an external growth strategy and an additional [1] for application to the case study.\nAward a maximum of [4].\n",

    "markScheme": "Positive impact of MNCs on the host countries:\n\n- Job creation\n- Higher nation income\n- Knowledge and technology transfer\n- Increase competition\n\nNegative impact of MNCs on the host countries:\n\n- Job losses\n- Repatriation of profits\n- Vulnerability\n- Social responsibilities\n- Competitive pressures\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response}}$: \nMultinational Corporations (MNCs) have a complex interplay of positive and bad elements that have a diverse impact on the host countries in which they operate. On the plus side, MNCs can greatly aid in creating jobs in the host nation. Local workers are frequently hired by these firms when they establish their operations, which lowers unemployment rates and gives local workers vital possibilities. In turn, this raises the general level of living for the inhabitants of the host nation and encourages economic stability. MNCs often bring substantial investments, technologies and resources, which lead to increased economic output and tax revenues. The host country can benefit from enhanced trade and export opportunities, contributing to a higher gross domestic product (GDP). Foreign capital and expertise can stimulate economic growth and development, improving living standards and public infrastructure.\nRecognising that MNC influence can be two-sided because adverse effects can occur in host nations. The potential loss of jobs is one of these detrimental effects. Local labour may be displaced if MNCs adopt more effective production techniques or outsource specific tasks. Even though MNCs generate jobs, some will likely be lost due to the inability to adapt to the changing labour market, which could exacerbate income inequality and social problems. A percentage of the profits MNCs make in the host country are frequently sent back to the country where the company was founded. This could lead to a drain on the host country's financial resources, reducing the ability to reinvest earnings in local projects.\nMark Allocation:\n2 marks for identifying each impacts.\n2 marks for explaining each impacts.\nTotal - 4 marks",
