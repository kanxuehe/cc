      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Morphological traits, or structures, are useful for creating cladograms. However, cladograms created by comparing such traits may be inaccurate because distantly related organisms can have structures that appear similar but have different genetic bases. The appearance of similar structures with a different evolutionary basis is not evidence of relatedness, but rather is evidence of convergent evolution. So, one reason the cladogram based on the DNA sequences is more reliable than the cladogram based on structures is that similar structures can be coded for by different genes in genetically distant organisms.Choice Ais incorrect because structures are inherited when species diverge, and the inheritance of structures is beneficial for constructing cladograms.  This is because shared structures are sometimes, but not always, evidence of genetic relatedness.Choice Bis incorrect because DNA does change over time. Scientists look at sequences of changes in DNA to determine evolutionary relatedness.Choice Dis incorrect because different structures are generally coded for by different DNA sequences.",
