      "content": "Leafy Bites is a small, family-run business that specialises in selling freshly prepared vegetarian and vegan lunches. Operating from a single location in a small town, the owners have intentionally kept the business small allowing them to maintain close relationships with their loyal customers and to focus on quality over rapid expansion.While Leafy Bites has a strong reputation locally, it has considered internal growth strategies such as expanding the menu and extending opening hours to attract more customers. However, these changes have placed extra pressure on the small team, leading to longer working hours and operational inefficiencies.The owners have been approached by potential investors interested in turning Leafy Bites into a franchise to expand into larger cities. While the owners see franchising as an opportunity to grow the brand, they are concerned about losing control over quality and customer service, which are central to their current success.Statetwo reasons why businesses choose to remain small.[2]In the context of Leafy Bites,explaintwo disadvantages of internal growth.[4]In the context of Leafy Bites,outlineone advantage and one disadvantage of franchising.[4][Maximum 10]",

Leafy Bites is trying to grow by expanding its menu and increasing opening hours, but this method is slow and puts pressure on its small team, limiting how quickly the business can capture more customers or revenue.Internal growth often places strain on a firm’s existing resources, such as staff, equipment, and management time, without bringing in the immediate support that external growth could provide. By trying to grow internally, Leafy Bites has increased workloads for its small team, leading to longer working hours and inefficiencies. This strain affects the business’s ability to maintain quality and operate effectively.Mark allocation:Mark as 2 + 2Award[1]for a relevant disadvantage with an additional[1]. for application to the case study.Award a maximum of[4].Sample response:Franchising allows a business to expand rapidly into new markets without having to invest large amounts of its own capital. The franchisees cover the costs of setting up and running their own outlets, making growth less risky and less expensive for the franchisor.\nFor Leafy Bites, franchising would allow the brand to expand into larger cities more quickly without the owners needing to invest heavily in new locations. This could help the business grow its market presence and reputation beyond its small town.One disadvantage of franchising is that the franchisor loses some control over how franchisees run their outlets. This can lead to inconsistencies in product quality, customer service, and brand reputation if franchisees do not follow the original business standards.\nThe owners of Leafy Bites are concerned that by franchising, they may lose control over the high quality and personalised customer service that has been key to their success.

After establishing a solid presence in the Chinese market, Link Electronics is considering expanding its business internationally and is looking at Australia as a new potential market for their existing smartphone products.As the company has grown, increased production levels have enabled it to bulk purchase components from suppliers. These savings have allowed Link Electronics to maintain competitive pricing while protecting profit margins. However, Link Electronics has also started experiencing some challenges related to its size. Managers have reported issues with poor communication across its increasingly large production and marketing teams, leading to delays in decision-making and product launches.In addition to expanding into Australia, Link Electronics is also exploring the possibility of developing a new battery technology that charges 50% faster than its current models.

For instance, acquiring a company immediately increases the acquiring company's size, market share, and resources. This rapid expansion is particularly advantageous in fast-moving industries or when a company must adjust quickly to market changes. It's also a quick way to access new technologies, products, or markets without the time and resources needed to develop them internally.Economies of scalerefer to the cost advantages a business obtains due to expansion. As the scale of operation increases, the cost per production unit typically decreases. Here's how external growth can enhance economies of scale:Increased Production: By acquiring or merging with another company, a business can increase its production capacity, leading to lower costs per unit due to the spread of fixed costs over a larger output.Purchasing Power: Larger organisations often have greater bargaining power with suppliers, which can lead to reduced costs for raw materials and other inputs.Market Access: Expanding into new markets (geographical or product markets) can increase the customer base, spreading the fixed costs of operations over a more extensive revenue base, thus reducing the average cost.This can result in more competitive pricing, higher margins, or both, which are crucial for long-term business sustainability and market competitiveness.Disadvantages:Higher cost: External growth costs more than internal growth.Greater risk: The uncertainties of external growth translate to more significant risks.Culture clash: Combining two organisations can result in a culture clash.Sample response:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}Sample response:​Higher cost: External growth comes with a high price tag. Acquisition of another organisation requires interest-bearing finance. The price for the acquisition might be high, with shareholders taking advantage and demanding a higher-than-fair price.Greater risk: External growth, such as mergers and acquisitions, carries greater risk due to the complexities of integrating different organisational cultures, systems, and processes. This can lead to operational disruptions and employee dissatisfaction. Additionally, the significant financial investment required for external growth poses a risk if the anticipated benefits and synergies still need to be fully realised. These challenges, coupled with potential regulatory hurdles and stakeholder resistance, make external growth a riskier strategy than internal growth's more controlled and incremental approach.Culture clash: Two organisations coming together during the process of external growth can experience a cultural clash due to the difference in governance and management styles. While this can be eventually resolved, the resulting conflict can result from inefficient operations and decisions, causing tangible financial losses and a dissatisfied customer base.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each advantage and disadvantage.2 marksfor explaining each advantage and disadvantage..Total- 4 marks",

      "markScheme": "Internal growth, also known as organic growth, refers to the expansion of a business through the use of its own resources and capabilities. This growth is typically achieved through increasing output, enhancing sales, or improving the business's products or services, often by reinvesting profits back into the business. It is characterized by a gradual and steady growth trajectory. External growth involves the business expanding outside its activities, commonly through mergers, acquisitions, or alliances with other businesses. This type of growth can enable a business to increase its market share, diversify its product offerings, or enter new markets more rapidly than internal growth.Financial Cost: Internal growth is relatively inexpensive; external growth has a higher economic cost.Risk: Internal growth is a less risky method of growth. External growth can entail higher risks.Control and Coordination: Internal growth allows the organisation to maintain control, whereas external growth can dilute control.Corporate Culture: Internal growth is the same. External growth can cause a culture clash.Slower, quicker: Internal growth could be faster to implement, whereas external growth is faster to increase production/sales.Talent Pool: Internal growth has a restricted talent pool. External growth can bring in a talent pool with complimenting knowledge, skills and expertise.Economies of Scale: Internal growth beyond the optimal limit can result in diseconomies of scale. External growth is more likely to show economies of scale.Sample response:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}Sample response:​Retained profits are the primary source of funding internal growth; therefore, there is negligible financing cost. The organisation might acquire an interest-bearing loan, but the size of this loan would be relatively small. Furthermore, borrowing costs would be more favourable due to the lower perceived risk.External growth often involves significant investment or financial outlay with an interest payment burden; the risk involved in external growth results in higher borrowing costs.Internal growth builds on the existing strengths of an organisation, such as brand value and customer loyalty. This factor, in combination with continuity in governance and management culture and the lower cost of funding growth, adds up to a lower risk.External growth can carry more risk due to a potential clash of management culture, a higher financial cost of growth and more significant uncertainties.Despite the risk involved, external growth is often favoured as it is a quicker method of increasing production/sales, often bringing the advantage of a greater pool of skills.Internal growth allows an organisation to maintain control and implement better coordination between departments. Internal growth is, therefore, easier to execute and manage.External growth dilutes control. It can lead to difficulty in coordination and result in inefficiencies.In internal growth, there is continuity of governance and corporate values, with no resulting clash of management styles.External growth can result in two organisations with vastly different management styles and cultures having to work together.

      "content": "Cooperativa Esperanza is an agricultural cooperative made up of small-scale farmers in Guatemala. By working together, these farmers pool their resources to purchase supplies in bulk, share machinery, and access larger markets to better compete with bigger agricultural businesses.In light of increased competition and innovations in farming methods, the cooperative recognises the need to invest in more modern machinery. However, obtaining additional funding has proven difficult due to limited access to finance for rural businesses. The cooperative also struggles with poor local infrastructure, including unreliable transportation and limited access to technology, which further hinders efficiency and market access.Recently, a large publicly held company (PLC) approached Cooperativa Esperanza with a takeover offer. Some of the older members, who are close to retirement, are interested in accepting the offer as it would provide them with a secure financial exit. However, the younger members are concerned about their future employment and the long-term impact on agriculture in the region if the cooperative is absorbed by a larger corporation.Definethe term takeover.[2]Describethe impact of one external diseconomy of scale on Cooperativa Esperanza.[2]Explainone reason why they should and two reasons why they should not accept the takeover bid.[6][Maximum 10]",

These members may prefer financial stability over the uncertainty of continuing operations in a challenging market. Accepting the takeover would allow them to receive a guaranteed payment, helping them retire comfortably without worrying about the future performance of the cooperative.The shareholders of a publicly held company (PLC) are typically motivated by profit maximization and the expectation of regular dividends. To achieve this, the PLC is likely to prioritize cost reductions, which could include cutting jobs, reducing wages, or restructuring operations. This contrasts sharply with the objectives of the cooperative, which focuses on supporting its members' livelihoods and the local farming community. Therefore, younger members are justifiably concerned that a takeover would result in job losses and undermine their future security.Rejecting the takeover could help preserve local control over agriculture and protect the community’s interests. If the cooperative is taken over, decisions will likely be made by the PLC’s executives based on profit motives rather than the long-term well-being of small-scale farmers in Guatemala. This could lead to reduced investment in sustainable farming practices and weaken the agricultural traditions and independence of the region.Mark allocation:Mark as 2 + [2 + 2]Award[1]for identifying one reason to accept the takeover bid and an additional[1]for explaining it up to a maximum of[2].Award[1]for identifying one reason not to accept the takeover bit and an additional[1]for explaining it, up to a maximum of[2].For each reason not to accept mark as2 + 2.Award a maximum of[6].",

      "markScheme": "Advantages of external growthQuicker than organic growth—\\text{\\textemdash}—Because external resources and funds are used, external growth is frequently a quicker option to expand and diversify.Synergies—\\text{\\textemdash}—Companies can gain from a larger talent pool, information, and outside experts.Lessened competition—\\text{\\textemdash}—Increasing the firm's market share through external growth is a quick, albeit expensive, way to lessen rivalry.Economies of scale—\\text{\\textemdash}—Businesses can access larger markets and, as a result, have economies of scale from operating on a greater scale, thanks to rapid external growth.Spreading risks—\\text{\\textemdash}—Businesses gain from diversification thanks to external growth. As a result, businesses are often less at risk of failing in a certain area of their operations.Disadvantages of external growthMore expensive than internal growth—\\text{\\textemdash}—External growth strategies, including mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and franchising, are typically more expensive.Greater risksare created by inadequate market information and the increased unpredictability of external growth.Regulatory hurdles—\\text{\\textemdash}—Governments may obstruct external growth, such as acquisitions and takeovers, if the action is considered anti-competitive.Potential diseconomies of scale—\\text{\\textemdash}—Increasing internal growth complexity can also result in inefficiencies and a consequent increase in average costs.Organisational culture conflict—\\text{\\textemdash}—It can be challenging to blend several cultures and management philosophies, particularly when external growth changes a company's character and culture.Sample response:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}Sample response:​The speed of external growth is one of its main benefits. External growth uses external resources and funds instead of organic growth, which depends on internal resources and labour-intensive development. This frequently causes the business to expand and diversify considerably more quickly. A privately held company can easily access new markets, clientele, and technology through mergers and acquisitions (M&As), joint ventures, strategic alliances, or franchising. This acceleration might give the privately held company a competitive advantage, especially in fast-paced industries where getting products to market quickly is critical.On the other hand, external expansion tactics have some significant drawbacks, with cost being the main issue. M&As, joint ventures, and other external growth strategies are often more expensive than organic ones. Legal fees, transaction charges, integration costs, and the cost of buying already-existing assets or businesses may all be included in the costs. Furthermore, external development frequently involves a learning curve resulting in unanticipated operational or cultural difficulties. A privately held company's resources may be taxed by the costs and complications of external growth, necessitating careful planning, investigation, and risk management. For external expansion initiatives to be in line with the overall goals and long-term viability of the organisation, it is critical to strike a balance between expediency and financial ramifications.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each impact of growing externally for a privately held company.2 marksfor explaining each impact of growing externally for a privately held company.Total- 4 marks",

      "markScheme": "Economies of Scale:Companies aim to achieve economies of scale to enhance their growth prospects. This goal is driven by the desire to reduce average production costs as production volumes increase.There are various types of economies of scale, categorised as internal and external economies of scale.Internal Economies of ScaleInternal economies of scale involve adopting new technologies to enhance productivity, accessing financing at lower interest rates, employing specialised staff to improve output quality and volume, spreading advertising costs over larger production quantities, and procuring inventory in bulk at reduced rates.External Economies of ScaleExternal economies of scale arise when a company gains access to new customer segments. For instance, an e-commerce business can significantly expand its customer base. Another example is when a company operates in an area with skilled workers, leading to lower recruitment and training expenses, thereby enhancing productivity and efficiency.Diseconomies of ScaleAs companies expand, their production capacity grows. However, if a company fails to operate close to its capacity, average costs and unit costs may rise, resulting in diseconomies of scale.Diseconomies of scale can be further categorized as internal and external.Internal Diseconomies of ScaleInternal diseconomies of scale often arise due to communication challenges, demotivation among staff from repetitive tasks and increased workloads, bureaucratic hurdles, and slower decision-making processes stemming from larger hierarchical structures, all of which can directly impact production levels.External Diseconomies of ScaleExternal diseconomies of scale occur when fixed costs escalate, including larger building rents due to increased production volumes and higher wages to retain skilled employees amidst increased job opportunities.",

      "markScheme": "Economies of scalerefer to the cost advantages a business can achieve as it increases the scale of its production or operations.Diseconomies of scaleis a situation in which a business experiences an increase in average costs as it continues to expand its production or operations.Key factors of economies of scaleCost reduction: As operations' scale grows, economies of scale cause a decline in the mean production costs.Efficiency: Greater production volumes result in increased resource utilisation and operational efficiency.Competitive advantage: Achieving economies of scale can give a business the upper hand by enabling it to offer items at cheaper costs or of higher quality.Investment in technology: Scale economies are frequently fueled by the application of cutting-edge technology and automation.Specialisation: As production rises, cost savings from the specialisation of labour and resources are possible.Lower manufacturing costs per unit: Lower manufacturing costs per unit translate into larger profit margins for the company.Key factors of diseconomies of scaleCost increase: As activities continue to expand in scope, diseconomies of scale cause an increase in average production costs.Efficiency issues: Managing a larger organisation may bring about efficiency issues, such as communication problems and coordination issues.Complexity: As a business grows, it can become more difficult to run, which would raise administrative and operating costs.Bureaucracy: More bureaucratic structures are frequently developed by larger organisations, which can impede efficiency and slow decision-making.Staff morale: Due to decreased job satisfaction and a perception of being cut off from the organisation's goals, scale inefficiencies can have a detrimental impact on staff morale.Adaptability: As organisations grow bigger, it is possible that they lose some of their ability to modify and respond to market demand changes.Sample response:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample response:}}Sample response:​As a company grows and changes in size and production volume, economies of scale and diseconomies of scale reflect two separate stages in the development of a corporation. Economies of scale, a crucial stage of growth, are identified by a number of distinctive characteristics. The most notable aspect is cost reduction—\\text{\\textemdash}—average manufacturing costs fall as operations' scale increases. This is a result of improved economies of scale-driven operational efficiencies, more effective resource utilisation, and reduced per-unit manufacturing costs. A business can offer items at more competitive pricing or of higher quality thanks to economies of scale, giving it a competitive edge and improving its market position and profitability.In contrast, certain crucial elements are at play when a corporation encounters diseconomies of scale. The development of increasingly complex and bureaucratic systems in larger organisations is one of the key contributing reasons. These frameworks may inhibit decision-making and impede efficiency, which limits adaptation.Another crucial element related to diseconomies of scale is adaptability. Organisations may become less able to respond to shifting consumer demands as they get bigger. It may be difficult to quickly pivot or modify tactics due to the growing complexity of operations and decision-making processes. The key distinctions between economies and diseconomies of scale highlight how crucial effective management and strategic decision-making are as a firm grows, as well as the careful balancing act needed to maximise benefits while minimising costs.Mark Allocation:2 marksfor identifying each difference.2 marksfor explaining each difference.Total- 4 marks",

Padel is a racket sport that blends elements of tennis and squash, and it is expanding rapidly worldwide—an opportunity the founders of PadelPro recognized early, leading them to enter the market with innovative court solutions.The company serves luxury resorts, fitness centers, and publicly funded sports facilities across Europe and the Middle East. It uses customisable, weather-resistant courts built with sustainably sourced materials. In 2024, PadelPro installed over 150 courts and earned €2.3 million in revenue.PadelPro offers end-to-end services, including design, installation, and maintenance. It benefits from economies of scale by purchasing materials in bulk, reducing costs while maintaining quality.To support international growth, PadelPro merged with a German sports construction firm and plans to expand into the U.S. market through partnerships with franchises.Definethe external growth method franchising.[2]Outlineone difference between internal and external growth, with reference to PadelPro Systems.[2]Explaintwo reasons why PadelPro Systems might want to grow.[4]Explaintwo reasons why PadelPro chose a merger as a method of external growth.[4][Maximum 12]",

They would grant selected U.S. based individuals or businesses (the franchisees) the right to operate under the PadelProSystems brand.The franchisees operating local businesses in the U.S. would market and install PadelPro Systems courts in the U.S. They would also benefit from training and support provided by PadelPro Systems.In the process PadelPro Systems expands its presence and earns income without opening and managing physical offices or hiring U.S. staff directly. It gains brand recognition, revenue streams from fees/royalties and market knowledge from local partners.Sample response:Internal growth occurs organically using the businesses own resources, such as increasing output. For example, PadelPro Systems expanded their output to install 150 padel courts whereas external growth involves merging with another company, as PadelPro did with a German firm.Mark allocation:Award[1]for outlining a clear difference between internal and external growth.Award[1]for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.Additional information:Examples of Internal growth (organic growth) include:Increasing output or sales.Launching new products.Entering new markets independently.Investing in new technology or facilities.Examples of external growth (Inorganic growth) include:Mergers.and acquisitions (M&As).Takeovers.Strategic alliances.Joint ventures.Franchising.Sample response:One reason for PadelPro Systems to grow is to increase their market share, especially as demand for padel courts rises globally.  By expanding into new markets early, PadelPro can attract more clients and establish itself as a leading provider before competitors gain traction.A second reason for PadelPro Systems to grow is to achieve cost savings through economies of scale. As PadelPro grows and installs more courts across Europe and the Middle East, it can buy materials in bulk and streamline their operations, reducing average costs and increasing their profit margins.Mark allocation:Award[1]for identifying one reason to grow.Award[1]for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.Award[1]for identifying a second reason to grow.Award[1]for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.Additional information:The advantages of being a small business include:Lower operating costs incurred so less cash flow issues.Easier communication between employees.Customised services to individual customer's preferences.Less competition in the small businesses.The advantages of being a large businesses include:Access to a highly skilled and experienced workforce due to greater recruitment resources.Strong brand recognition, leading to customer loyalty and market trust.Greater financial capacity to invest in research and development (R&D) for innovation.Larger market share, contributing to higher sales revenue and potential economies of scale.Sample response:One reason to merge with a German construction firm is to expand geographically. By partnering with a company already established in Germany, PadelPro can benefit from the local firm’s existing customer base and supplier networks. This reduces the costs and risks associated with entering a foreign market alone and allows them to access new clients, such as sports clubs and luxury resorts more efficiently than through internal (organic) growth.A second reason to merge with a German construction firm is to achieve synergies by sharing technical expertise and Research & Development costs for new padel court technologies. As a result, collaboration on innovation can accelerate the development of advanced, weather-resistant court designs, providing a clear competitive advantage.Mark allocation:Award[1]for identifying one reason to merge.Award[1]for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.Award[1]for identifying a second reason to merge.Award[1]for application in the context of PadelPro Systems.Additional information:Further advantages of Mergers are:Economies of scale.

For PureEssence, this includes when it hired more staff, acquired additional raw materials and equipment, and rented extra storage space to increase production of popular products like the aloe vera moisturiser. Internal growth is organic and allows PureEssence to maintain full control over the business expansion but requires significant investment and time.External growth, on the other hand, would involve PureEssence expanding through partnerships or collaborations with other organisations. For example, the proposed joint venture with a leading animal rights group is a form of external growth. This allows PureEssence to leverage external expertise and resources to grow quicker or enter new markets but may require sharing control and profits with the partner.Mark allocation:Award[1]for stating the concept of internal growth.Award[1]for explaining internal growth with application to PureEssence.Award[1]for stating the concept of external growth.Award[1]for explaining external growth with application to PureEssence.Up to a maximum of[4].Sample response:Partnering with a respected animal rights organization can significantly strengthen PureEssence’s ethical image and cruelty-free credentials. This association not only appeals to the growing segment of consumers who value animal welfare and ethical production but also builds greater customer trust and loyalty. Being aligned with a leading advocacy group could set PureEssence apart in an increasingly competitive and value-driven beauty market.One important reason PureEssence should hesitate is that entering a joint venture can stretch its limited staff and resources, particularly when the company is already facing pressures from scaling production and managing growth.
