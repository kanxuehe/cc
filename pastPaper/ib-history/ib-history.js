The Japanese also established the Kwantung Governor-general to administer the newly acquired Liaodong Peninsula ($\\checkmark$).\nThe Japanese victory also cemented Japanese economic interests in Northeast Asia. Most notably, Japan acquired control of the South Manchurian Railway, which was gradually expanded by Japanese investors and settlers over the next two decades ($\\checkmark$). Moreover, in order to extract revenue from the region, the Kwantung Governor-general also cultivated opium in Manchuria, which eventually became an important source of income for the expansion of the Kwantung Army ($\\checkmark$).',

The Chinese Government has in various ways invoked action on the part of foreign governments, citing its reliance upon treaty obligations and inviting special reference to the Kellogg Pact.\r\n\n\nThis situation is of concern, morally, legally and politically to a considerable number of nations. It is not exclusively a matter of concern to Japan and China. It brings into question at once the meaning of certain provisions of agreements, such as the Nine Powers Treaty of February 6, 1922, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.\r\n\n\nThe American Government is confident that it has not been the intention of the Japanese Government to create or to be a party to the creation of a situation which brings the applicability of treaty provisions into consideration. The American Government does not wish to be hasty in formulating its conclusions or in taking a position. However, the American Government feels that a very unfortunate situation exists, which no doubt is embarrassing to the Japanese Government. It would seem that the responsibility for determining the course of events with regard to the liquidating of this situation rests largely upon Japan, for the simple reason that Japanese armed forces have seized and are exercising de facto control in South Manchuria.\r\n\n\nIt is alleged by the Chinese, and the allegation has the support of circumstantial evidence, that lines of communication outward from Manchuria have been cut or interfered with. If this is true, it is unfortunate.\r\n[Source: Memorandum by the Secretary of State (1931). Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, Japan, 1931-1941, Volume I.

The Japanese Government made several decisions during these two years that exacerbated the situation. Unable or unwilling to control the military, Japan's political leaders sought greater security by establishing the $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” in August, 1940. In so doing they announced Japan's intention to drive the Western imperialist nations from Asia. However, this Japanese-led project aimed to enhance Japan' economic and material wealth so that it would not be dependent upon supplies from the West, and not to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$liberate” the long-subject peoples of Asia. In fact, Japan would have to launch a campaign of military conquest and rule, and did not intend to pull out of China. At the same time, several pacts with Western nations only made Japan appear more of a threat to the United States. First, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy on September 27, 1940 and thereby linked the conflicts in Europe and Asia. This made China a potential ally in the global fight against fascism. Then in mid-1941, Japan signed a Neutrality Pact with the Soviet Union, making it clear that Japan's military would be moving into Southeast Asia, where the United States had greater interests. A third agreement with Vichy France enabled Japanese forces to move into Indochina and begin their Southern Advance. The United States responded to this growing threat by temporarily halting negotiations with Japanese diplomats, instituting a full embargo on exports to Japan, freezing Japanese assets in U.S. banks, and sending supplies into China along the Burma Road. (...)\r\n\n\nFaced with serious shortages as a result of the embargo, unable to retreat, and convinced that the U.S. officials opposed further negotiations, Japan's leaders came to the conclusion that they had to act swiftly. For their part, U.S. leaders had not given up on a negotiated settlement, and also doubted that Japan had the military strength to attack the U.S. territory. Therefore they were stunned when the unthinkable happened and Japanese planes bombed the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.\n[Source: Japan, China, the United States and the Road to Pearl Harbor, 1937-41.

Source E says that even though the Japanese were in a stalemate in China, instead of giving up, they were looking to access more raw materials to be able to continue fighting ("finding themselves in a stalemate in China and needing more natural resources to sustain the war") while Source F says Japan $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$did not intend to pull out of China," which means they planned to continue the war against China.\n- Both sources speak of Japan\'s expansion as a plan of both civilian and military leaders.

Mussolini is depicted pulling Baldwin and Laval on roller skates, symbolizing that the League is being manipulated and cannot stop Mussolini's aggression in Abyssinia. This suggests the League's inability to enforce collective security.\n- The figures of Baldwin (British Prime Minister) and Laval (French Foreign Minister) on roller skates imply that Britain and France, key members of the League, are not actively resisting Mussolini. Instead, they are being dragged, which shows their complicity or unwillingness to challenge Italy's invasion.\n- The title $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Discussions are proceeding\" is ironic, emphasizing that ongoing diplomatic efforts are not leading to any effective action.

Instead of leading the situation, the League is shown as being dragged along, highlighting its weakness in dealing with the crisis ($\\checkmark$).\r\nAnother message is that Britain and France, as key League members, are shown as passive and ineffective. The cartoon suggests that both countries, represented by Baldwin and Laval, are unwilling to take meaningful action against Mussolini.

This extract is about the Hoare-Laval Pact of 1935 and its implications.Dissension developed between Paris and London over a wholly different question. Should Britain, in return for half-hearted French support of the half-hearted British policy of half-heartedly pretending to restrain Italian aggression in Africa, promise to fulfill the obligations of the Covenant and of Locarno against Germany? Paris desired such a pledge and was willing to pay for it by going as far as necessary with Britain in “coercing” Italy, so long as both understood that Il Duce [Mussolini] must not be alienated or confronted with any serious risk of defeat. London was unwilling to assume any definite commitments vis-à-vis the Reich even after France and other States had pledged defense of Britain against a hypothetical Italian attack. This pledge was quite safe: all knew there would be no Italian attack. There would be no effective sanctions which would provoke attack. The British and French leaders had no desire to make sanctions effective and thereby jeopardize Italian prospects of victory.\r\n[Schuman, Frederick L.

This gives the source great value as it reflects the perceptions of someone living through the immediate crises of the 1930s.\n- Schuman's purpose is to critique the diplomatic ineptitude of Britain and France in addressing the Italian and German threats. This reveals the frustration of contemporary observers with appeasement policies, making the source valuable for understanding contemporary critiques of diplomacy.\n- The source focuses on the diplomatic indecision and half-hearted efforts of Britain and France to address the Italian aggression in Africa and German rearmament. His emphasis on $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$half-hearted\" policies highlights the core weaknesses of international diplomacy in the period.\n\nFor limitations, any of the following:\n\n- The source's publication date, 1939, can also limit its perspective (origin) as Schuman's analysis lacks the hindsight that later historians would have, potentially missing broader historical patterns or developments that became clear only after the war began.\n- Schuman's critical stance may lead to an overly negative portrayal of their actions, potentially ignoring the broader context of why appeasement policies were adopted, such as economic difficulties and public opposition to another war.\n- Schuman's emphasis on their $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$half-hearted\" efforts may downplay other diplomatic considerations, such as the economic constraints and domestic political pressures that influenced their policies.

Schuman, a historian offering a near-contemporary analysis of European diplomacy leading up to World War II. Schuman's proximity to the events allows for an authentic and immediate critique of the diplomatic tensions, particularly between Britain, France, and Italy. ($\\checkmark$ VO) His purpose of critically analysing the failures of Britain and France in restraining Italian aggression and addressing the German threat provides valuable insight into the growing frustration with appeasement policies at the time ($\\checkmark$ VP). Additionally, the source's content, which emphasizes the reluctance of Britain and France to act decisively, sheds light on the ineffective diplomatic strategies that contributed to the failure of collective security in the 1930s ($\\checkmark$ VP).\nHowever, the source also has limitations, particularly because Schuman wrote it in 1939, before the full consequences of these diplomatic decisions were fully understood ($\\checkmark$ LO). Schuman's purpose of condemning the indecisiveness of the European powers risks oversimplifying their decisions, as it neglects to fully consider the economic constraints and public opinion against war, which were significant factors behind appeasement ($\\checkmark$ LP). Furthermore, the content focuses narrowly on the diplomatic failures of Britain and France, without taking into account the broader international context, such as the roles of the United States or the Soviet Union, which limits the source's ability to provide a complete picture of the diplomatic landscape ($\\checkmark$ LC).",

By so doing we shall have heavily insured ourselves against the greatest danger to which we are present exposed: indeed by substantially reducing Germany’s only chance of a rapid decision, we shall have provided a strong deterrent against her making the attempt.\r\n\n\n(c) It follows, therefore, that, from the military point of view, time is in our favour, and that, if war with Germany has to come, it would be better to fight her in say 6-12 months' time, than to accept the present challenge.[Source: Ismay, H.

The article seeks to justify Chamberlain's appeasement policy.As a central figure in British politics during a tumultuous decade—first as Chancellor of the British Exchequer from 1931-1937, then as Prime Minister—Chamberlain had to address a complex of problems that reached well beyond a revived Germany and a ranting dictator. Britain faced threats across the globe: Germany in Europe, Italy in the Mediterranean, and, perhaps most troubling of all, Japan in Asia and the Pacific. A war with any one of those three surely would lead the other two to horn in on British territories or possessions. Notions that Chamberlain did not comprehend the threat Germany posed or that appeasement constituted moral cowardice on his part or that Winston Churchill was the only figure on Britain’s political scene calling for rearmament and a hard line against Hitler—all standard to the anti-Chamberlain dossier—oversimplify history to the point of falsity.\r\n\n\nIn the late 1930s, just about every important figure in British government, and/or at least the Conservative Party, knew that it was time to spend on national defense. In November 1933, 10 months after Hitler seized power, the British cabinet created a committee on defense requirements to study the cost of military modernization and how long the process would take. That planning culminated in early 1935 in a $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$White Paper.” The findings? Even if rearmament began immediately, Britain would not be ready to fight Germany until 1939. The analysis described weapons not yet in production, some of them only prototype sketches. The $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Thirty-Niners,” as rearmament advocates were called, realized wishes took time to become reality, and that until then the thing to do was negotiate, buy time, and avoid a new war. And so, from 1935 on, Britain was in a juggling act: trying to appease Hitler, but also feverishly girding for an inevitable war. In that context, Chamberlain's much-maligned policy, distasteful as it appears, made some sense. Engaging Hitler in talks and turning a cheek to his invective gained Britain time to man up. Chamberlain probably did feel his actions might make war unnecessary, and even if he failed he could say—as he did on September 1, 1939—that he acted $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$with a clear conscience.”\r\n\n\nBy then Britain was ready to fight—or at least far readier than a year before. $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Last September we might have lost a short war,” Lieutenant General Henry Pownall, the army's chief planner, wrote at the time. “Now we shouldn't, nor a long one either.”[Source: Citino, R.

Source 2 mentions that Britain would benefit from a delay of 6-12 months to improve defenses against Germany's air power. Similarly, Source 3 emphasizes that Britain was targeting 1939 for readiness, as rearmament took years to reach effective levels..\n- Each source acknowledges the military danger posed by Germany. Source 2 discusses Germany’s potential to enhance its power and threaten France and Britain directly, while Source 3 indicates that British leaders viewed Germany as part of a global threat matrix that required careful attention.\n- Both sources suggest that rearmament was tied to appeasement. In Source 2, military buildup is linked to buying time against a possible German attack, while Source 3 indicates that appeasement was seen as a way to delay conflict until Britain was ready to confront Germany militarily.\nFor contrast, any of the following differences:\n- Source 2 views delaying a confrontation with Germany as a short-term tactic, suggesting a 6-12 month window for Britain to strengthen defenses. In contrast, Source 3 presents appeasement as a longer-term approach to buy time until full readiness by 1939, considering it necessary due to global commitments.\n- Source 2 focuses narrowly on the immediate military threat posed by Germany and specifically discusses the impact of Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia on European security. Source 3, however, discusses Britain's broader geopolitical challenges, including threats from Italy and Japan, showing that British priorities extended beyond Europe.\n- Source 2 does not mention Chamberlain directly, nor does it justify appeasement; it primarily discusses the military advantages of postponing conflict. In contrast, Source 3 explicitly defends Chamberlain's policy, arguing that his approach made sense given Britain's military limitations and that he was actively preparing Britain for a likely war.\n<span class=\"marks\">[6 marks maximum]</span>\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$:\r\n\nBoth sources highlight that time was essential for Britain to build up its military strength before any possible conflict with Germany ($\\checkmark$ similarity). In Source A, there's an emphasis on the benefit of even a short delay, suggesting that an additional 6-12 months would help Britain catch up in air defenses against Germany. Similarly, Source B reflects the need for time, indicating that Britain required several years of preparation to reach a state of readiness by 1939 ($\\checkmark$ evidence) Additionally, both sources show a shared understanding that Germany posed a serious threat to Britain ($\\checkmark$ similarity). Source A underscores the risk of Germany gaining a stronger military foothold in Europe, while Source B situates Germany as part of a broader set of threats facing Britain, reflecting a recognition of the country's growing danger ($\\checkmark$ evidence).However, the sources differ in how they view the role of appeasement. Source 2 presents delay as a short-term, tactical response to give Britain some additional time, while Source 3 depicts appeasement as a longer-term strategy to strengthen British defenses over multiple years, aiming for sustained readiness by 1939 ($\\checkmark$ difference $\\checkmark$ evidence). Another difference lies in the scope of threats each source addresses. Source 2 is focused on Germany's actions in Europe, particularly in Czechoslovakia, as a primary concern. In contrast, Source 3 places Germany within a global context, showing that British officials were also concerned with threats from Italy and Japan, which required careful balancing of resources across multiple regions ($\\checkmark$ difference $\\checkmark$ evidence).",

True, it would have preferred that the Hoare-Laval plan had been adopted, which would have given Mussolini only part of Abyssinia, but the honest British people who believed that the principles of the League should be carried out, spoiled it all. Then the British government entered on its policy of reprimanding Mussolini severely, but the words were not followed by acts.\r\n\n\nIn summing up the Abyssinian story it must be stated that neither Britain nor France was ignorant of the ultimate aims of Mussolini; yet they not only did nothing to help Abyssinia, but rather prevented her from acquiring the necessary arms for defense, in the hope that Mussolini\'s friendship could thus be bought. He was assisted, also, by the long diplomatic conferences which he knew meant nothing. To be sure, at one time he feared that public opinion in England might demand the closing of the Suez Canal, but he need not have worried, since the British government had no intention of hindering him. The sanctions passed by the League were not carried out. Oil sanctions were solemnly discussed by various committees of nineteen and thirteen and committees of experts, but Mussolini threatened that if an oil embargo were declared he would fight. Just how he could have dared fight Britain and France and the other League members combined was never explained, but the bluff worked. No oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini. By use of gas and airplanes against a practically unarmed people Mussolini was able to subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence. The abortive sanctions and the reprimands of the British government and press were deeply resented by Mussolini who has never forgotten these $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$insults" to Italian honor.\r\n\n\nOn May 2, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie left Abyssinia and the Italians announced that they had obtained another great addition to their colonial empire. On May 9, from a balcony at the Palazzo Venezia, the Duce delivered a speech of defiance and proclaimed the king of Italy, emperor of Abyssinia. Adowa was avenged.\r\n\n[Source: Maxwell, Bertram Wayburn (1939). International Relations. HathiTrust Digital Library. Retrieved November 1, 2024 from https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.$b589970.

The sanctions, however, proved ineffective because the League did not dare to impose the only sanction, the oil embargo, which would have brought the Fascist government to reason. Mussolini threatened that Italy would leave the League if it dared to execute faithfully the provisions of the Covenant, and the League backed down. Six months later Mussolini told an audience at Milan on November 1, 1936, that the League must either renew itself or perish, and $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$as it is difficult to see how it can renew itself, as far as we are concerned it can tranquilly perish."

Although there has been re-established the National Government of China, with which Japan has effected neighborly intercourse and cooperation, the regime which has survived at Chungking, relying upon American and British protection, still continues its fratricidal opposition. Eager for the realization of their inordinate ambition to dominate the Orient, both America and Britain, giving support to the Chungking regime, have aggravated the disturbances in East Asia.

      'Why, according to the source, was the Stimson Doctrine not effective in responding to Japanese aggression?\r\n<span class="marks">[3]</span>\n\n$\\\\$\nSource $\\hspace{3em}$ $\\hspace{3em}$From the office of the United States Historian. This source describes events centred on the US response to the Manchurian Crisis.In the 1920s and 1930s, the United States had a number of interests in the Far East. The United States engaged in trade and investment in China. American missionaries representing many denominations worked within the region. The United States also claimed Pacific territories, including the Philippines, Guam, and Hawaii. The United States defended its interests in the region through a three-pronged Far Eastern policy: it included the principle of the Open Door for guaranteeing equal access to commercial opportunities in China, a belief in the importance of maintaining the territorial integrity of China, and a commitment to cooperation with other powers with interests in the region.\r\n\nIn the 1930s, events transpired that challenged all of these policies. On September 18, 1931, an explosion destroyed a section of railway track near the city of Mukden. The Japanese, who owned the railway, blamed Chinese nationalists for the incident and used the opportunity to retaliate and invade Manchuria. However, others speculated that the bomb may have been planted by mid-level officers in the Japanese Army to provide a pretext for the subsequent military action. Within a few short months, the Japanese Army had overrun the region, having encountered next to no resistance from an untrained Chinese Army, and it went about consolidating its control on the resource-rich area. The Japanese declared the area to be the new autonomous state of Manchukuo, though the new nation was in fact under the control of the local Japanese Army.\r\n\nThe United States and other western powers were at a loss on how to respond to the rapidly developing crisis. Even as the Japanese moved far from the original site of the $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$attack” at Mukden to bomb the city of Jinzhou (Chinchow), there was little sense that U.S. interests in the area were anywhere near profound enough to make military intervention necessary or desirable. Given the 1930s worldwide depression, there was little support for economic sanctions to punish the Japanese. Instead, the United States sat in on League of Nations council meetings for the first time to try to convince the League to enforce the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which both Japan and China had signed. Appeals based on the pact, however, proved ineffective.\r\n\nTherefore Secretary Stimson issued the Stimson Doctrine in early 1932. This Doctrine stated that the United States would not recognize any treaty or agreement between Japan and China that violated U.S. rights or agreements to which the United States subscribed. This doctrine of non-recognition proved incredibly ineffectual in the face of on-going Japanese aggression and expansion. Japan had been expanding its influence in Manchuria for years, and now it formally controlled the territory. Moreover, after its successful conquest of Manchuria, the Japanese attacked the city of Shanghai in 1932. As Shanghai was home to the largest international settlements in China, the sudden invasion threatened foreign concessions as well. Stimson responded to this development by declaring that as a result of Japanese violation of the Nine Power Treaty, the United States would no longer consider itself bound by the naval limitations agreements. This meant a potential new naval arms race in the Pacific that would inevitably draw in the Japanese, but it did not change the situation in Manchuria.\r\n[Source: The Mukden Incident of 1931 and the Stimson Doctrine (2018, April 8).

      "Compare and contrast what Sources E and F suggest about Japan's expansion in East Asia.\r\n<span class=\"marks\">[6]</span>\n\n$\\\\$\nSource E $\\hspace{3em}$ $\\hspace{3em}$Excerpt from $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$World History, Volume 2: from 1400.” Published by OpenStax,  2022.The Great Depression and the rise of fascism in Europe seemed to signal the decline of the older Western-dominated world order. Japanese intellectuals, politicians, military leaders, and mass media envisioned that Japan could fashion a $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$new order” of regional supremacy for itself. In an August 1940 radio address, Japanese foreign minister Yosuke Matsuoka broached his vision for a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a blueprint for Japan's ascent to world-power status. A year later, he published a book further developing his ideas for liberating Asians from European domination and expelling the $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$white race bloc” suppressing Asia's destiny. By 1941, creating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere had become the publicly articulated objective of Japan's Asian aggression, and it remained so until Japan's defeat in 1945.\r\n\n\nEventually, finding themselves in a stalemate in China and needing more natural resources to sustain the war and the goal of creating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese military and civilian governments began to consider a thrust into Southeast Asia. Such a move would inevitably mean a confrontation with the United States and its colony the Philippines. Japan conceived a desperately hopeful plan of war against the United States and an initial knockout strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.\r\n\n[Source: Kordas, A.; Lynch, R.; Nelson, B.

The Japanese Government made several decisions during these two years that exacerbated the situation. Unable or unwilling to control the military, Japan's political leaders sought greater security by establishing the $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” in August, 1940. In so doing they announced Japan's intention to drive the Western imperialist nations from Asia. However, this Japanese-led project aimed to enhance Japan' economic and material wealth so that it would not be dependent upon supplies from the West, and not to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$liberate” the long-subject peoples of Asia. In fact, Japan would have to launch a campaign of military conquest and rule, and did not intend to pull out of China. At the same time, several pacts with Western nations only made Japan appear more of a threat to the United States. First, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy on September 27, 1940 and thereby linked the conflicts in Europe and Asia. This made China a potential ally in the global fight against fascism. Then in mid-1941, Japan signed a Neutrality Pact with the Soviet Union, making it clear that Japan's military would be moving into Southeast Asia, where the United States had greater interests. A third agreement with Vichy France enabled Japanese forces to move into Indochina and begin their Southern Advance. The United States responded to this growing threat by temporarily halting negotiations with Japanese diplomats, instituting a full embargo on exports to Japan, freezing Japanese assets in U.S. banks, and sending supplies into China along the Burma Road. (...)\r\n\n\nFaced with serious shortages as a result of the embargo, unable to retreat, and convinced that the U.S. officials opposed further negotiations, Japan's leaders came to the conclusion that they had to act swiftly. For their part, U.S. leaders had not given up on a negotiated settlement, and also doubted that Japan had the military strength to attack the U.S. territory. Therefore they were stunned when the unthinkable happened and Japanese planes bombed the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.\n[Source: Japan, China, the United States and the Road to Pearl Harbor, 1937-41.

Source E talks about $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$liberating Asians from European domination" by setting up the Greater East Asia co-Prosperity Sphere and Source F speaks of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$drive the Western imperialist nations from Asia".\n- Both sources speak of Japan continuing its war on China. Source E says that even though the Japanese were in a stalemate in China, instead of giving up, they were looking to access more raw materials to be able to continue fighting ("finding themselves in a stalemate in China and needing more natural resources to sustain the war") while Source F says Japan $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$did not intend to pull out of China," which means they planned to continue the war against China.\n- Both sources speak of Japan\'s expansion as a plan of both civilian and military leaders. Source E says, $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$The Japanese military and civilian governments began to consider a thrust into Southeast Asia," and Source F says Japanese politicians were $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$unable or unwilling to control the military" in their desire for expansion.\n- Both sources speak of the intention of expanding into Southeast Asia and how this would bring a confrontation with the US. Source E says $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$the Japanese military and civilian governments began to consider a thrust into Southeast Asia. Such a move would inevitably mean a confrontation with the United States" and Source F speaks of a similar predicament when it states that $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Japan\'s military would be moving into Southeast Asia, where the United States had greater interests."\nFor contrast, any the following difference:\n- The sources disagree about Japan\'s objective in creating the Greater East Asia co-Prosperity Sphere. Source E describes Japan\'s noble intention of stopping the Europeans from $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$suppressing Asia`s destiny" while Source F says it was actually  $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$aimed to enhance Japan\'s economic and material wealth so that it would not be dependent upon supplies from the West”, and not to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$liberate” the long-subject peoples of Asia." as the Japanese had stated.\n<span class="marks">[6 marks maximum]</span>\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$:\r\n\nSources E and F share many similarities. They both mention Japan\'s objective of getting rid of Western domination over Asia ($\\checkmark$ similarity). Source E talks about Japan\'s goal of $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$liberating Asians from European domination" by establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and we can also see this in Source F where it describes Japan\'s effort to $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$drive the Western imperialist nations from Asia" ($\\checkmark$evidence). Both sources also talk about Japan\'s persistence in continuing its war on China ($\\checkmark$ similarity) with Source E stating that the Japanese were "finding themselves in a stalemate in China and needing more natural resources to sustain the war," while Source F states that Japan "did not intend to pull out of China." ($\\checkmark$ evidence). Furthermore, both sources agree that Japan\'s expansionist ambitions were supported by both civilian and military leaders ($\\checkmark$ similarity). Source E mentions that $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$the Japanese military and civilian governments began to consider a thrust into Southeast Asia," while Source F mentions that Japanese politicians were "unable or unwilling to control the military" in its push for expansion ($\\checkmark$ evidence).However, they also have a key contrast. Source E presents the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as something positive that seeks to end European suppression of $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Asia\'s destiny" while Source F says that  the co-Prosperity Sphere was a $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$Japanese-led project aimed to enhance Japan\'s economic and material wealth so that it would not be dependent upon supplies from the West, and not to $\\text{\\textquoteleft}$liberate\' the long-subject peoples of Asia."

    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\r\n\nAny one to three of the following arguments to support the claim:\n\n- The cooperation also provided the KMT to receive military advisers such as Alexander von Falkenhausen, in which the KMT military became a well-trained centralised military.\n- The Chinese were also able to produce modern weapons under licence from German factories and were used widely by the KMT throughout the war.\n- The Sino-German cooperation allowed the KMT forces to modernise itself, enabling the KMT to have notable success against the Japanese invasion by holding off the Japanese for 3 months in the Battle of Shanghai during the early phases of the 2nd Sino-Japanese War.\n\nAny one to three of the following arguments to reject the claim:\n\n- The cooperation was short-lived from 1928 to 1937 due to the Anti-Comintern Pact between Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.\n- The original goal of the military reform under the support of German advisors aimed to modernise 60 divisions, but only a third were fully modernised in the end.\n- China was in no capacity to produce heavy artillery and weaponry at its stage, the modernisation only focused on small arms and infantry tactics.\r\n\n<span class="marks">[4 marks maximum]</span>  \n\nConcluding remark:\n\n- Responses are likely to conclude that Sino-German Cooperation was important to China\'s military modernisation since it gave the KMT the necessary equipment and training to fight as a modernised military against Japan.\n- The strongest responses will mention arguments that both support and reject the notion that Sino-German cooperation was important.\r\n\n<span class="marks">[1 mark maximum]</span>  \n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$:\r\n\nThe Sino-German Cooperation was important in providing the KMT the opportunity to modernise its military by having German advisers training the KMT military ($\\checkmark$). In addition, under the cooperation, the Chinese were able to produce German weapons under licence, which boosted the strength of the KMT\'s military  ($\\checkmark$). Due to the military modernisation under the Sino-German cooperation, the KMT was able to have notable success against the Japanese invasion by holding off the Japanese for 3 months in the Battle of Shanghai in 1937 ($\\checkmark$).\nHowever, it could also be argued that the cooperation was rather short-lived from 1928 to 1937 due to the Anti-Comintern Pact signed between Nazi Germany and Japan in 1936, therefore the KMT was unable to fully modernise its military by the time of the war ($\\checkmark$)\nTo conclude, although the Sino-German cooperation was short-lived, the cooperation during the brief period still provided the KMT the necessary means to fight in the 2nd Sino Japanese War, therefore the cooperation was still significant in China\'s military modernisation ($\\checkmark$).',

True, it would have preferred that the Hoare-Laval plan had been adopted, which would have given Mussolini only part of Abyssinia, but the honest British people who believed that the principles of the League should be carried out, spoiled it all. Then the British government entered on its policy of reprimanding Mussolini severely, but the words were not followed by acts.\r\nIn summing up the Abyssinian story it must be stated that neither Britain nor France was ignorant of the ultimate aims of Mussolini; yet they not only did nothing to help Abyssinia, but rather prevented her from acquiring the necessary arms for defense, in the hope that Mussolini\'s friendship could thus be bought. He was assisted, also, by the long diplomatic conferences which he knew meant nothing. To be sure, at one time he feared that public opinion in England might demand the closing of the Suez Canal, but he need not have worried, since the British government had no intention of hindering him. The sanctions passed by the League were not carried out. Oil sanctions were solemnly discussed by various committees of nineteen and thirteen and committees of experts, but Mussolini threatened that if an oil embargo were declared he would fight. Just how he could have dared fight Britain and France and the other League members combined was never explained, but the bluff worked. No oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini. By use of gas and airplanes against a practically unarmed people Mussolini was able to subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence. The abortive sanctions and the reprimands of the British government and press were deeply resented by Mussolini who has never forgotten these $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$insults" to Italian honor.\r\nOn May 2, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie left Abyssinia and the Italians announced that they had obtained another great addition to their colonial empire. On May 9, from a balcony at the Palazzo Venezia, the Duce delivered a speech of defiance and proclaimed the king of Italy, emperor of Abyssinia. Adowa was avenged.\r\n[Source: Maxwell, B. W. (1939).

This extract is about the Hoare-Laval Pact of 1935 and its implications.Dissension developed between Paris and London over a wholly different question. Should Britain, in return for half-hearted French support of the half-hearted British policy of half-heartedly pretending to restrain Italian aggression in Africa, promise to fulfill the obligations of the Covenant and of Locarno against Germany? Paris desired such a pledge and was willing to pay for it by going as far as necessary with Britain in “coercing” Italy, so long as both understood that Il Duce [Mussolini] must not be alienated or confronted with any serious risk of defeat. London was unwilling to assume any definite commitments vis-à-vis the Reich even after France and other States had pledged defense of Britain against a hypothetical Italian attack. This pledge was quite safe: all knew there would be no Italian attack. There would be no effective sanctions which would provoke attack. The British and French leaders had no desire to make sanctions effective and thereby jeopardize Italian prospects of victory.\r\n[Schuman, Frederick L.

This gives the source great value as it reflects the perceptions of someone living through the immediate crises of the 1930s.\n- Schuman's purpose is to critique the diplomatic ineptitude of Britain and France in addressing the Italian and German threats. This reveals the frustration of contemporary observers with appeasement policies, making the source valuable for understanding contemporary critiques of diplomacy.\n- The source focuses on the diplomatic indecision and half-hearted efforts of Britain and France to address the Italian aggression in Africa and German rearmament. His emphasis on $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$half-hearted\" policies highlights the core weaknesses of international diplomacy in the period.\n\nFor limitations, any of the following:\n\n- The source's publication date, 1939, can also limit its perspective (origin) as Schuman's analysis lacks the hindsight that later historians would have, potentially missing broader historical patterns or developments that became clear only after the war began.\n- Schuman's critical stance may lead to an overly negative portrayal of their actions, potentially ignoring the broader context of why appeasement policies were adopted, such as economic difficulties and public opposition to another war.\n- Schuman's emphasis on their $\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$half-hearted\" efforts may downplay other diplomatic considerations, such as the economic constraints and domestic political pressures that influenced their policies. It also ignores the role of other states.\r\n  \n<span class=\"marks\">[4 marks maximum]</span>  \n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$:\r\n\nThis source holds significant value as it was written in 1939 by Frederick L. Schuman, a historian offering a near-contemporary analysis of European diplomacy leading up to World War II. Schuman's proximity to the events allows for an authentic and immediate critique of the diplomatic tensions, particularly between Britain, France, and Italy. ($\\checkmark$ VO) His purpose of critically analysing the failures of Britain and France in restraining Italian aggression and addressing the German threat provides valuable insight into the growing frustration with appeasement policies at the time ($\\checkmark$ VP). Additionally, the source's content, which emphasizes the reluctance of Britain and France to act decisively, sheds light on the ineffective diplomatic strategies that contributed to the failure of collective security in the 1930s ($\\checkmark$ VP).\nHowever, the source also has limitations, particularly because Schuman wrote it in 1939, before the full consequences of these diplomatic decisions were fully understood ($\\checkmark$ LO). Schuman's purpose of condemning the indecisiveness of the European powers risks oversimplifying their decisions, as it neglects to fully consider the economic constraints and public opinion against war, which were significant factors behind appeasement ($\\checkmark$ LP). Furthermore, the content focuses narrowly on the diplomatic failures of Britain and France, without taking into account the broader international context, such as the roles of the United States or the Soviet Union, which limits the source's ability to provide a complete picture of the diplomatic landscape ($\\checkmark$ LC).",

      "$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n\nThe following:\n\n- Stresemann had restored Germany's place on the world stage through his work at Locarno\n- Stresemann's death happened within a month of the Wall Street Crash meaning that he was not able to help mitigate the impact of the economic crisis\n- Stresemann had been key to stabilising German diplomacy in the 1920s, even earning a Nobel Peace Prize in 1926 for his work. Without him, German politics was more vulnerable to extremist views and polarisation\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[2 marks maximum]</span>  \n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$:\n\nGustav Stresemann was one of the foremost politicians of Weimar Germany who gained international recognition for his work. He was a key figure in restoring Germany's place on the world stage through his work at Locarno ($\\checkmark$) which helped Germany be admitted to the League of Nations. He stabilised Germany diplomacy in the 1920s and was even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926, so significant was his work to restore relations with France ($\\checkmark$).",

      "$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\r\n\nA combination of the below that meets the following guidelines:\n\n- Both values and limitations must be addressed. If only one is addressed, award a maximum of two marks.\n- Origin, purpose and content must all be referenced at some point in the response (either as a value, limitation or both) to receive the full four marks.\n\nFor value, any of the following:\n\n- The origin of the source, a speech by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in 1938 immediately after his meeting with Hitler following the signing of the Munich Agreement is valuable as Chamberlain is considered the main architect of the policy of appeasement and this speech would reflect his views at that particular period of time.\n- The purpose of the speech is valuable as it emphasizes the steps taken by Britain to ensure peace with Germany and reveals Britain's position on Hitler's demands.\n- The content of the source, outlining the specific accommodations made by Britain both in the earlier Anglo-British Naval Treaty and the recent Munich agreement is of value as it gives specific details of Britain's policy of Appeasement to ensure the prevention of hostilities.\n\nFor limitations, any of the following:\n\n- The origin of the source is a limitation, as the speech was given in 1938 and hence does not give the historian an idea of how the Munich Agreement contributed to the outbreak of the Second World War.\n- The purpose of the speech also poses a limitation, as while it reveals Chamberlain's desire for maintaining peace, it does not cast light on other factors such as Britains state of rearmament and military preparedness that also played a role in Chamberlain's decisions in Munich.\n- The content of the speech too can be a limitation as it does not cast light on other factors such as Germany's military strength in 1938 evidenced by her role in the Spanish Civil War and the hope a strong Germany could prevent the spread of Communism from the Soviet Union.\r\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[4 marks maximum]</span>  \n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$:\r\n\nThe origin of Source B is valuable as it is a speech in 1938 by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain immediately after his meeting with Hitler after signing the Munich Agreement. As Chamberlain is considered the main architect of the policy of appeasement, this speech would reflect his immediate views on the Agreement with Hitler ($\\checkmark$ VO). The purpose of the source is also valuable as it reflects Britain's desire to keep peace with Germany ($\\checkmark$ VP). Lastly the content of the source holds value as it outlines the specific accommodations made by Britain both in the earlier Anglo-British Naval Treaty and the recent Munich agreement in order to ensure the prevention of hostilities ($\\checkmark$ VC).\nThe origin of the source poses a limitation as the speech from 1938 does not give the historian an idea of how the Munich Agreement contributed to the outbreak of the Second World War the following year ($\\checkmark$ LO). In addition, the purpose of the source has limitations as it does not cast light on other factors such as Britains state of rearmament and military preparedness that also played a role in Chamberlain's decisions in Munich ($\\checkmark$ LP). Finally the content of the source has limitations as the speech does not cast light on other factors that contributed to shaping the policy of appeasement, such as Germany's military strength by 1938 evident in the role she played in the Spanish Civil War and the hope that a strong Germany would help prevent the spread of Communism from the Soviet Union ($\\checkmark$ LC).",

      'Analyse two failures of the League of Nations in the 1930s and explain how they contributed to the rise of fascist expansion in Europe in the 1930s.\r\n<span class="marks">[4]</span>\n',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\r\n\nAny two of the following:\n\n- Failure to act decisively in Manchurian Crisis 1931:\n  \n  - Lytton Commission was delayed and ineffective, and no enforcement of its findings were taken. Showed fascist powers like Italy and Germany that League would not stand in the way of territorial expansion and emboldened their foreign policy\n\n- Weak response to Abyssinian Crisis 1935:\n  \n  - Sanctions imposed were weak and ineffective and excluded essential resources like oil. This demonstrated the League’s inability to take meaningful action and paved the way for Italian and German expansion, ultimately leading to an alliance,\n\n- Failure of diplomacy and appeasement:\n  \n  - The policy of appeasement followed by Britain and France, two main members of the League who were pursuing self-interest , meant that they were largely unwilling to confront fascist aggression, shown, for example, by their lack of response to the invasion of the Rhineland, and the agreements made at the 1938 Munich Conference. This provided fascist leaders with confirmation that their expansionism would likely not be challenged.\n\n- Failure of disarmament:\n  \n  - League’s disarmament initiatives failed, such as at the 1932-33 Disarmament Conference. Hitler, having left the league after his requests for equal armaments were rejected, gained confidence in the fact that international efforts to limit military build up were ineffective.\r\n\n<span class="marks">[4 marks maximum]</span>    \n\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$:\r\n\nOne failure of the League of Nations was its failure to act decisively in response to Japan\'s invasion of Manchuria in 1931. The commission it sent, the Lytton Commission, was slow and ineffective, and its findings were not enforced ($\\checkmark$). As a result, European fascist powers such as Italy and Germany felt emboldened by the fact that it appeared that the League would provide little opposition to territorial expansion ($\\checkmark$). A second failure of the League of Nations in the 1930s was its weak response to the Abyssinian Crisis. The sanctions that the LON imposed were ineffective because they left out essential resources like oil ($\\checkmark$). As a result, European powers like Germany and Italy saw that the League was unable to meaningfully respond to their aggression and thus saw nothing to prevent their continued expansion ($\\checkmark$).\n($\\checkmark$)\r\n$\\text{\\textquotedblleft}$',
