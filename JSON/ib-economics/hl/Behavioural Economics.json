      "markScheme": "Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:When looking at decision−-−making, we assume that consumers engage inrational consumer choice. These assumptions include the idea that consumers are consistent in their decision−-−making, they haveperfect informationwhen making decisions, and they will always seek to consume goods and services that maximise their utility[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}[T]. While these assumptions are helpful for developing economic theory and models, they have their limitations. Two examples of these limitations are the idea ofbounded rationalityand the presence of biases like theanchoring bias.One key assumption of rational consumer choice is perfect information.Perfect informationis the idea that consumers always have all available information about a good or service they wish to purchase. In practice, consumers are subject to bounded rationality[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. It would be too costly in terms of time, resources, or money to gather all the information a consumer needs to choose the good or service that maximises their utility. Even if these costs were not an issue, the human mind may be incapable of processing the volume of information that would be necessary to make the utility−-−maximising choice[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. These limitations mean that consumers are only rational up to a certain point[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. Consumers instead tend to aim to make the choice they find the most satisfying, even if it is not the maximising choice[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].Cognitive biasescan also pose a challenge to the assumption of perfect information in consumer decision−-−making[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].Availability bias, for example, refers to the tendency to rely on the most recent information available when making a decision[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. Instead of fully examining all available information, decisions are made using the information that consumers most recently remember, and often, this information is considered more reliable than previous information even if there is nothing specific to indicate the information is any more trustworthy[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. This implies that a consumer may make decisions based on what they most clearly remember, which may lead to choices that do not maximise utility[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].Explanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Terminology[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}Terminology[T]For correctly using the termrational consumer choiceby indicating that consumers make choices based on the assumptions of consistency in taste and preferences, that they have perfect information, and seek to maximise their utility.

Since choice architecture can be used to influence choices, it can effectively be applied to address certain market failures[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. One area where choice architecture has been successfully applied is in organ donation.In June 2023, Northern Ireland passed a law making all adults in the country potential organ donors by default unless they belong to an excluded group[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE]. This is an example ofdefault choice, a type of choice architecture in which a choice is made by doing nothing[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. The choice, in this case, is becoming a potential organ donor.\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/8efca0e9-7907-4be2-b4e2-f1d094f3c45c/images/c197aee6-306f-4d4a-a770-fd632605cee0/EC0402%20fig3.png)\n\nAlthough many lives are saved through organ donation, a number of people die waiting for transplants as the demand for transplant organs (QDQ_DQD​) exceeds the available supply (QSQ_SQS​)[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D]. The organ transplant market is also unique in that it typically does not rely on price to stimulate supply in order to avoid perverse incentives such as a black market for organ transplant sales[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E].\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/8efca0e9-7907-4be2-b4e2-f1d094f3c45c/images/a9ce918c-7631-4bb6-a56f-6bdcba089bd3/EC0402%20fig4.png)\n\nBy making organ donation the default choice for all adult citizens in Northern Ireland, the organs available for transplants increase fromS1S_1S1​toS2S_2S2​[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D], which may minimise the number of patients who do not receive transplants[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].This type of choice architecture is effective in this case because it represents a low-cost solution to the issue of long transplant lists [RWE]. Beyond the opportunity costs associated with informing the people of Northern Ireland of the change, the actual cost of implementing this type of choice architecture is minimal[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E]. People are also generally in favour of organ donation but may forget to register as an organ donor, or they fail to inform their family members of their desire to donate their organs. By making the default choice opting-in, the process of registering and informing relatives is simpler[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E]. Citizens also still maintain freedom of choice as they can choose to opt out of the program. However, the inconvenience of opting out may keep people who are indifferent about organ donation on the donor list, maintaining the increase in supply of available donors[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E].Although choice architecture is likely to be very effective in increasing organ donation, it may be ineffective on its own to discourage other behaviours[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E]. An example of this is the market for cigarettes. The United Kingdom usesrestricted choiceto discourage the consumption of cigarettes, such as banning the display of tobacco products[RWE]\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}[RWE]. While keeping tobacco products out of sight may discourage some consumers from smoking, cigarettes are highly addictive and a mild inconvenience may not be enough to reduce consumption[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E]. Unlike indirect taxes, choice architecture also does not have the advantage of generating tax revenue, which could be used to address the negative externalities that a product like cigarettes generates[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E]. This is likely the reason why the UK government levies taxes on tobacco products in addition to the restricted choice interventions it uses[S/E]\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}[S/E].Explanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Terminology[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}Terminology[T]For correctly using the term‘`‘choice architecture' by indicating that it relates to the idea of framing and designing environments in a way that influences decision-making.
