To determine evolutionary rates, both sequence similarity and known divergence times are needed.Choice Cis incorrect because the lowest sequence similarity (50%) between human and zebrafish suggests the longest time since divergence, not the most recent.Choice Dis incorrect because differences in sequence similarity alone cannot demonstrate variation in molecular clock rates.

The definition given in the table describes diploidy (2n), which is the standard chromosome number in most sexually reproducing organisms;Choice Aincorrect.Interbreeding between different species can sometimes produce infertile offspring, such as a horse × donkey = mule. This is an example of reproductive isolation because the hybrid offspring is sterile, preventing gene flow between the two species. However, because horses and donkeys are already separate species, this does not result in speciation—it simply reinforces their reproductive barrier. For reproductive isolation to lead to speciation, it must occur within a single species, preventing interbreeding between different populations.Choice Cis incorrect.Mutations are random changes in DNA sequences, not in the amino acid sequence;Choice Dis incorrect.",

In this case the mutation confers resistance to a disease, making these individuals more likely to survive and pass on the mutation to their offspring.  Over time resistance to the disease becomes more prevalent in the population.Choice Ais incorrect because traits acquired through an organism's lifetime cannot be passed on to the next generation.Choice Cis incorrect because mutations are random and do not occur because an individual or population requires a different trait.Choice Dis incorrect because complexity is not a measure of evolutionary progress, as evolution refers to change over time.",

      "markScheme": "BExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Choice Bis correct because both Lamarckism and epigenetic inheritance propose that environmental factors can cause inherited changes, while Lamarckism suggested these changes were permanent and led to evolution through traits acquired during an organism's lifetime. Epigenetic changes involve reversible chemical modifications to DNA or histone proteins that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. These epigenetic changes can be passed to offspring, but often only persist for a few generations and typically do not lead to long-term evolutionary change.Choice Ais incorrect because neither Lamarckism nor epigenetic inheritance involves changes to the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetics modifies gene expression through chemical tags, while Lamarckism assumed physical or behavioural changes were inherited.Choice Cis incorrect because only Lamarckism proposed that the use or disuse of traits directly causes evolutionary change. Epigenetic inheritance does not involve the use or disuse of structures but rather chemical changes to gene regulation influenced by environmental factors. Furthermore, epigenetics does not lead to evolution.Choice Dis incorrect because epigenetic inheritance does not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself and therefore does not cause long-term evolutionary change.",
