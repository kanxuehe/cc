Japanese intellectuals, politicians, military leaders, and mass media envisioned that Japan could fashion a“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“new order” of regional supremacy for itself. In an August 1940 radio address, Japanese foreign minister Yosuke Matsuoka broached his vision for a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a blueprint for Japan's ascent to world-power status. A year later, he published a book further developing his ideas for liberating Asians from European domination and expelling the“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“white race bloc” suppressing Asia's destiny. By 1941, creating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere had become the publicly articulated objective of Japan's Asian aggression, and it remained so until Japan's defeat in 1945.Eventually, finding themselves in a stalemate in China and needing more natural resources to sustain the war and the goal of creating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese military and civilian governments began to consider a thrust into Southeast Asia. Such a move would inevitably mean a confrontation with the United States and its colony the Philippines. Japan conceived a desperately hopeful plan of war against the United States and an initial knockout strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.[Source: Kordas, A.; Lynch, R.; Nelson, B.

To cultivate friendship among nations and to enjoy prosperity in common with all nations has always been the guiding principle of Our Empire's foreign policy. It has been truly unavoidable and far from Our wishes that Our Empire has now been brought to cross swords with America and Britain. More than four years have passed since China, failing to comprehend the true intentions of Our Empire, and recklessly courting trouble, disturbed the peace of East Asia and compelled Our Empire to take up arms. Although there has been re-established the National Government of China, with which Japan has effected neighborly intercourse and cooperation, the regime which has survived at Chungking, relying upon American and British protection, still continues its fratricidal opposition. Eager for the realization of their inordinate ambition to dominate the Orient, both America and Britain, giving support to the Chungking regime, have aggravated the disturbances in East Asia. Moreover, these two Powers, inducing other countries to follow suit, increased military preparations on all sides of Our Empire to challenge us.

Then the British government entered on its policy of reprimanding Mussolini severely, but the words were not followed by acts.\r\nIn summing up the Abyssinian story it must be stated that neither Britain nor France was ignorant of the ultimate aims of Mussolini; yet they not only did nothing to help Abyssinia, but rather prevented her from acquiring the necessary arms for defense, in the hope that Mussolini's friendship could thus be bought. He was assisted, also, by the long diplomatic conferences which he knew meant nothing. To be sure, at one time he feared that public opinion in England might demand the closing of the Suez Canal, but he need not have worried, since the British government had no intention of hindering him. The sanctions passed by the League were not carried out. Oil sanctions were solemnly discussed by various committees of nineteen and thirteen and committees of experts, but Mussolini threatened that if an oil embargo were declared he would fight. Just how he could have dared fight Britain and France and the other League members combined was never explained, but the bluff worked. No oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini. By use of gas and airplanes against a practically unarmed people Mussolini was able to subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence. The abortive sanctions and the reprimands of the British government and press were deeply resented by Mussolini who has never forgotten these“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“insults\" to Italian honor.\r\nOn May 2, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie left Abyssinia and the Italians announced that they had obtained another great addition to their colonial empire. On May 9, from a balcony at the Palazzo Venezia, the Duce delivered a speech of defiance and proclaimed the king of Italy, emperor of Abyssinia. Adowa was avenged.[Source: Maxwell, B. W.

To cultivate friendship among nations and to enjoy prosperity in common with all nations has always been the guiding principle of Our Empire's foreign policy. It has been truly unavoidable and far from Our wishes that Our Empire has now been brought to cross swords with America and Britain. More than four years have passed since China, failing to comprehend the true intentions of Our Empire, and recklessly courting trouble, disturbed the peace of East Asia and compelled Our Empire to take up arms. Although there has been re-established the National Government of China, with which Japan has effected neighborly intercourse and cooperation, the regime which has survived at Chungking, relying upon American and British protection, still continues its fratricidal opposition. Eager for the realization of their inordinate ambition to dominate the Orient, both America and Britain, giving support to the Chungking regime, have aggravated the disturbances in East Asia. Moreover, these two Powers, inducing other countries to follow suit, increased military preparations on all sides of Our Empire to challenge us. They have obstructed by every means our peaceful commerce, and finally resorted to a direct severance of economic relations, menacing gravely the existence of Our Empire.[Source:Imperial Rescript, December 8, 1941.(1941, December 8th).

The United States was at peace with that Nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American Island of Oahu, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack.It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.[Source: Roosevelt, F. D.

      "markScheme": "Explanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Anytwoof the following reasons with supporting explanation:The US embargo on JapanThe US imposed an embargo on Japan due to Japan's invasion of China and Indochina.The oil embargo would bring devastating results to the Japanese military and economy since Japan lacked sufficient oil reserves to continue the war in China.Failure of negotiationsThe Hull Note was issued to the Japanese ambassador, who demanded that Japan withdraw its military from China and Indochina.The note would remove the embargo and the restrictions on Japanese assets in the US.The Japanese government saw the Hull note as an ultimatum rather than a diplomatic resolution to de-escalate the tensions.Pre-emptive strike strategy against the US NavyThe Japanese military planners predicted that invading the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia would prompt a military response from the US. This meant that war with the US was inevitable.These Japanese military planners believed that launching a surprise attack on the US naval base in Hawaii would temporarily knock the US out of the war and prevent the US from interfering with Japanese conquest in Southeast Asia.Japan's need for raw materials in Southeast AsiaThe US embargo effectively cut off Japan's primary source of oil for the war.Japan needed raw materials in Southeast Asia, such as rubber and oil, to continue its conquest of China.Japanese conquest of ChinaThe Japanese military unexpectedly faced strong resistance in China from the Nationalist army's scorched earth tactics and the Communists' guerrilla warfare tactics.In contrast to a quick and decisive victory against China, the Japanese military was bogged down in China for an extended period of time due to the overextension of supply lines.Japan lacked the resources for a prolonged war against China, which only heavily strained the Japanese economy.Japan's intelligence on British defences in Southeast AsiaGermany captured the shipAutomedon, which contained top-secret intelligence of the British Far East command. It revealed that the British lacked sufficient reinforcements for their Far East bases should there be a war.The Germans passed the intelligence to the Japanese, which may have encouraged the Navy to start the war in Southeast Asia.[4 marks maximum]Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:The attack on Pearl Harbour could be due to the following reasons. Firstly, Japan miscalculated the duration of the war in China, which went longer than expected and only caused more financial strains on the Japanese economy. Thus, the Japanese leaders needed more resources to continue the war and therefore captured territories in French Indochina (✓\\checkmark✓). Another reason for the attack on Pearl Harbour is that the strained relations between Japan and the US caused by the oil embargo, which effectively cut off Japan's primary source of oil (✓\\checkmark✓). The Japanese military planners had no choice but to invade the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia to acquire the raw materials to continue the war (✓\\checkmark✓). However, this meant that conflict with the US was inevitable; hence, the decision to launch a pre-emptive strike on Pearl Harbour was necessary to temporarily knock out the US Pacific Fleet to give Japan a free hand to invade Southeast Asia (✓\\checkmark✓).",

This extract is about the Hoare-Laval Pact of 1935 and its implications.Dissension developed between Paris and London over a wholly different question. Should Britain, in return for half-hearted French support of the half-hearted British policy of half-heartedly pretending to restrain Italian aggression in Africa, promise to fulfill the obligations of the Covenant and of Locarno against Germany? Paris desired such a pledge and was willing to pay for it by going as far as necessary with Britain in “coercing” Italy, so long as both understood that Il Duce [Mussolini] must not be alienated or confronted with any serious risk of defeat. London was unwilling to assume any definite commitments vis-à-vis the Reich even after France and other States had pledged defense of Britain against a hypothetical Italian attack. This pledge was quite safe: all knew there would be no Italian attack. There would be no effective sanctions which would provoke attack. The British and French leaders had no desire to make sanctions effective and thereby jeopardize Italian prospects of victory.[Schuman, Frederick L.

This gives the source great value as it reflects the perceptions of someone living through the immediate crises of the 1930s.Schuman's purpose is to critique the diplomatic ineptitude of Britain and France in addressing the Italian and German threats. This reveals the frustration of contemporary observers with appeasement policies, making the source valuable for understanding contemporary critiques of diplomacy.The source focuses on the diplomatic indecision and half-hearted efforts of Britain and France to address the Italian aggression in Africa and German rearmament. His emphasis on“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“half-hearted\" policies highlights the core weaknesses of international diplomacy in the period.For limitations, any of the following:The source's publication date, 1939, can also limit its perspective (origin) as Schuman's analysis lacks the hindsight that later historians would have, potentially missing broader historical patterns or developments that became clear only after the war began.Schuman's critical stance may lead to an overly negative portrayal of their actions, potentially ignoring the broader context of why appeasement policies were adopted, such as economic difficulties and public opposition to another war.Schuman's emphasis on their“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“half-hearted\" efforts may downplay other diplomatic considerations, such as the economic constraints and domestic political pressures that influenced their policies. It also ignores the role of other states.[4 marks maximum]Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:This source holds significant value as it was written in 1939 by Frederick L.

Schuman's proximity to the events allows for an authentic and immediate critique of the diplomatic tensions, particularly between Britain, France, and Italy. (✓\\checkmark✓VO) His purpose of critically analysing the failures of Britain and France in restraining Italian aggression and addressing the German threat provides valuable insight into the growing frustration with appeasement policies at the time (✓\\checkmark✓VP). Additionally, the source's content, which emphasizes the reluctance of Britain and France to act decisively, sheds light on the ineffective diplomatic strategies that contributed to the failure of collective security in the 1930s (✓\\checkmark✓VP).However, the source also has limitations, particularly because Schuman wrote it in 1939, before the full consequences of these diplomatic decisions were fully understood (✓\\checkmark✓LO). Schuman's purpose of condemning the indecisiveness of the European powers risks oversimplifying their decisions, as it neglects to fully consider the economic constraints and public opinion against war, which were significant factors behind appeasement (✓\\checkmark✓LP). Furthermore, the content focuses narrowly on the diplomatic failures of Britain and France, without taking into account the broader international context, such as the roles of the United States or the Soviet Union, which limits the source's ability to provide a complete picture of the diplomatic landscape (✓\\checkmark✓LC).",

      "content": "According to the source, what rationale does Japan provide to justify its actions in China?[3]\\\\Source\\\\\\\\\\hspace{3em}\\hspace{3em}Extract from the Lytton Report written in 1932. The Lytton Report was the official response of the League of Nations to the crisis in Manchuria.These facts must be considered by those who debate the issues. It is a fact that, without declaration of war, a large area of what was indisputably the Chinese territory has been forcibly seized and occupied by the armed forces of Japan and has, in consequence of this operation, been separated from and declared independent of the rest of China. The steps by which this was accomplished are claimed by Japan to have been consistent with the obligations of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington, all of which were designed to prevent action of this kind. Moreover, the operation which had only just begun when the matter was first brought to the notice of the League was completed during the following months and is held by the Japanese Government to be consistent with the assurances given by their representative at Geneva on September 30th and December 10th. The justification in this case has been that all the military operations have been legitimate acts of self-defence, the right of which is implicit in all the multilateral treaties mentioned above, and was not taken away by any of the resolutions of the Council of the League. Further, the administration which has been substituted for that of China in the Three Provinces is justified on the ground that its establishment was the act of the local population, who, by a spontaneous assertion of their independence, have severed all connection with China and established their own Government. Such a genuine independence movement, it is claimed, is not prohibited by any international treaty or by any of the resolutions of the Council of the League of Nations, and the fact of its having taken place has profoundly modified the applications of the Nine-Power Treaty and entirely altered the whole character of the problem being investigated by the League[Source: League Of Nations.

Since it ordered Japan to leave Manchuria, this angered Japan, prompting it to abandon the League of Nations in 1933.

Then the British government entered on its policy of reprimanding Mussolini severely, but the words were not followed by acts.In summing up the Abyssinian story it must be stated that neither Britain nor France was ignorant of the ultimate aims of Mussolini; yet they not only did nothing to help Abyssinia, but rather prevented her from acquiring the necessary arms for defense, in the hope that Mussolini's friendship could thus be bought. He was assisted, also, by the long diplomatic conferences which he knew meant nothing. To be sure, at one time he feared that public opinion in England might demand the closing of the Suez Canal, but he need not have worried, since the British government had no intention of hindering him. The sanctions passed by the League were not carried out. Oil sanctions were solemnly discussed by various committees of nineteen and thirteen and committees of experts, but Mussolini threatened that if an oil embargo were declared he would fight. Just how he could have dared fight Britain and France and the other League members combined was never explained, but the bluff worked. No oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini. By use of gas and airplanes against a practically unarmed people Mussolini was able to subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence. The abortive sanctions and the reprimands of the British government and press were deeply resented by Mussolini who has never forgotten these“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“insults\" to Italian honor.On May 2, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie left Abyssinia and the Italians announced that they had obtained another great addition to their colonial empire. On May 9, from a balcony at the Palazzo Venezia, the Duce delivered a speech of defiance and proclaimed the king of Italy, emperor of Abyssinia. Adowa was avenged.[Source: Maxwell, Bertram Wayburn (1939).International Relations. HathiTrust Digital Library. Retrieved November 1, 2024 from https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.$b589970.

The negotiations from January to May, 1936, were a repetition of those of November and December, 1935. The object in each case was to eliminate the risk of European war by preventing effective action against Italy, and the method employed was to side-track sanctions by holding out the hope of 'peace by conciliation.' This technique, which had succeeded so well before Christmas, was equally efficacious in the new year and it was still being practised with great dexterity when the termination of the war by a complete Italian victory rewarded the virtuosity of the diplomats and won them a hard-earned rest.During this second phase the task of those who were playing for safety was relatively easy. For the rejection of the Hoare-Laval Plan, which was a victory for the sanctionists, was also the high-water mark of their success. They were unable to follow it up and thenceforth were fighting a losing battle. There were only a small number of people actively conducting the campaign and they depended for support on the large mass of middle opinion, whose influence, although invariably decisive when it operates, is only sporadically exercised. This 'floating vote,' as it is sometimes called, represents the millions of liberal-minded and sentimental English people, who subscribe neither to conservatism or socialism, but who must be captured by any party which aspires to power. At the General Election in November 1935, the 'floating vote' had been cast for the National Government, largely as a reward for its support of the League. In December it swung violently away and forced the Government to repudiate the Hoare-Laval plan and its author. Logically it should have continued to exert pressure in favour of more and better sanctions. But the 'floating vote' is anything but logical; it is emotional, and intellectually lazy, and likes to be bothered with politics as little as possible. It had spent its emotional force in a nation-wide protest; having done that it was quite content to let the Government carry on and do what it thought best about Abyssinia. Its conscience was salved, and it was beginning to be bored with the whole affair.[Source: Martelli, George (1938).Italy Against The World; the first complete impartial account of Italy's repudiation of the League; her conquest of Abyssinia, by an English author with an intimate knowledge of the facts.

The Ruhr crisis of 1923 showed Germany's weakness on the international stage as French and Belgian troops marched into the Ruhr unopposed and the government could not remove them from its own soil (✓\\checkmark✓). As a result of passive resistance called for by the government, hyperinflation took hold which massively impacted everyday Germans as their currency lost its value (✓\\checkmark✓).The hyperinflation caused as a result of the crisis showed the weakness of the German government in resolving its difficulties (✓\\checkmark✓). Although the Ruhr crisis was eventually solved, the Dawes and Young plans put in place created an overreliance on financial support from the USA (✓\\checkmark✓). When the Wall Street Crash hit in 1929 and the USA demanded repayment of loans, Germany was not able to cope with the economic turmoil and this paved the way for Hitler to exploit the situation and present himself as the answer to Germany's troubles (✓\\checkmark✓).",

      "content": "What does the source suggest about the consequences of British and French actions for Czechoslovakia?[3]Source\\hspace{3em}A speech by Winston Churchill in the British House of Commons 5 October 1938.All is over... Czechoslovakia recedes into the darkness. She has suffered in every respect by her association with the Western democracies and with the League of Nations, of which she has always been an obedient servant. She has suffered in particular from her association with France, under whose guidance and policy she has been actuated for so long...We in this country, as in other Liberal and democratic countries, have a perfect right to principle of self-determination, but it comes ill out of the mouths of those in totalitarian states who deny even the smallest element of toleration to every section and creed their bounds...What is the remaining position of Czechoslovakia? Not only are they politically mutilated, but economically and financially, they complete confusion. Their banking, their railway arrangements, are severed and their industries are curtailed, and the movement of their population is most cruel... It is a tragedy which has occurred....I venture to think that in the future Czechoslovakian state cannot be maintained as an independent entity. You will find that in a period of time measured only by months, Czechoslovakia will be engulfed in the Nazi régime. Perhaps they may join it in despair or in revenge. At any rate, that story is over and told... It is the most grievous consequence which we have yet experienced of what we have done and of what we have left undone in the last five years—five years of futile good intention, five years of eager search for the line of least resistance, five years of uninterrupted retreat of British power, five years neglect of our air defenses. We have been reduced from a position of security, of safety and power—power to do good, power to be generous to a beaten foe, power to make terms with Germany, power to give her proper redress for her grievances, power to stop her arming if we chose, power to take any step in strength or mercy or justice which we thought right—reduced in five years from a position safe and unchallenged to where we stand now.When I think of the fair hopes of a long peace which still lay before Europe at the beginning of 1933 when Herr Hitler first obtained power, and of all the opportunities of arresting the growth of the Nazi power which have been thrown away, when I think of the immense combinations and resources which have been neglected or squandered, I cannot believe that a parallel exists in the whole course of history. So far as this country is concerned the responsibility must rest with those who have the undisputed control of our political affairs. They neither prevented Germany from rearming, nor did they re-arm ourselves in time... They neglected to make alliances and combinations which might have repaired previous errors, and thus they left us in the hour of trial without adequate national defense or effective international security...We are in the presence of a disaster of the first magnitude... Do not let us blind ourselves to that. It must now be accepted that all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will make the best terms they can with the triumphant Nazi Power…[Source: Churchill, W. (5 October 1938).

The Chinese Government has in various ways invoked action on the part of foreign governments, citing its reliance upon treaty obligations and inviting special reference to the Kellogg Pact.This situation is of concern, morally, legally and politically to a considerable number of nations. It is not exclusively a matter of concern to Japan and China. It brings into question at once the meaning of certain provisions of agreements, such as the Nine Powers Treaty of February 6, 1922, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.The American Government is confident that it has not been the intention of the Japanese Government to create or to be a party to the creation of a situation which brings the applicability of treaty provisions into consideration. The American Government does not wish to be hasty in formulating its conclusions or in taking a position. However, the American Government feels that a very unfortunate situation exists, which no doubt is embarrassing to the Japanese Government. It would seem that the responsibility for determining the course of events with regard to the liquidating of this situation rests largely upon Japan, for the simple reason that Japanese armed forces have seized and are exercising de facto control in South Manchuria.It is alleged by the Chinese, and the allegation has the support of circumstantial evidence, that lines of communication outward from Manchuria have been cut or interfered with. If this is true, it is unfortunate.[Source:Memorandum by the Secretary of State(1931). Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, Japan, 1931-1941, Volume I.

      "content": "Why, according to the source, was the Stimson Doctrine not effective in responding to Japanese aggression?[3]\\\\Source\\hspace{3em}\\hspace{3em}From the office of the United States Historian. This source describes events centred on the US response to the Manchurian Crisis.In the 1920s and 1930s, the United States had a number of interests in the Far East. The United States engaged in trade and investment in China. American missionaries representing many denominations worked within the region. The United States also claimed Pacific territories, including the Philippines, Guam, and Hawaii. The United States defended its interests in the region through a three-pronged Far Eastern policy: it included the principle of the Open Door for guaranteeing equal access to commercial opportunities in China, a belief in the importance of maintaining the territorial integrity of China, and a commitment to cooperation with other powers with interests in the region.In the 1930s, events transpired that challenged all of these policies. On September 18, 1931, an explosion destroyed a section of railway track near the city of Mukden. The Japanese, who owned the railway, blamed Chinese nationalists for the incident and used the opportunity to retaliate and invade Manchuria. However, others speculated that the bomb may have been planted by mid-level officers in the Japanese Army to provide a pretext for the subsequent military action. Within a few short months, the Japanese Army had overrun the region, having encountered next to no resistance from an untrained Chinese Army, and it went about consolidating its control on the resource-rich area. The Japanese declared the area to be the new autonomous state of Manchukuo, though the new nation was in fact under the control of the local Japanese Army.The United States and other western powers were at a loss on how to respond to the rapidly developing crisis. Even as the Japanese moved far from the original site of the“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“attack” at Mukden to bomb the city of Jinzhou (Chinchow), there was little sense that U.S. interests in the area were anywhere near profound enough to make military intervention necessary or desirable. Given the 1930s worldwide depression, there was little support for economic sanctions to punish the Japanese. Instead, the United States sat in on League of Nations council meetings for the first time to try to convince the League to enforce the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which both Japan and China had signed. Appeals based on the pact, however, proved ineffective.Therefore Secretary Stimson issued the Stimson Doctrine in early 1932. This Doctrine stated that the United States would not recognize any treaty or agreement between Japan and China that violated U.S. rights or agreements to which the United States subscribed. This doctrine of non-recognition proved incredibly ineffectual in the face of on-going Japanese aggression and expansion. Japan had been expanding its influence in Manchuria for years, and now it formally controlled the territory. Moreover, after its successful conquest of Manchuria, the Japanese attacked the city of Shanghai in 1932. As Shanghai was home to the largest international settlements in China, the sudden invasion threatened foreign concessions as well. Stimson responded to this development by declaring that as a result of Japanese violation of the Nine Power Treaty, the United States would no longer consider itself bound by the naval limitations agreements. This meant a potential new naval arms race in the Pacific that would inevitably draw in the Japanese, but it did not change the situation in Manchuria.[Source:The Mukden Incident of 1931 and the Stimson Doctrine(2018, April 8).

These principles include the principle of inviolability of territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and all nations; the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries; the principle of equality, including equality of commercial opportunity and treatment; and the principle of reliance upon international cooperation and conciliation for the prevention and pacific settlement of controversies and for improvement of international conditions by peaceful methods and processes.The Government of the United States and the Government of Japan propose to take steps as follows:1.1.1.The Government of the United States and the Government of Japan will endeavor to conclude a multilateral non-aggression pact among the British Empire, China, Japan, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, Thailand and the United States.2.2.2.Both Governments will endeavor to conclude among American, British, Chinese, Japanese, the Netherlands and Thai Governments an agreement whereunder each of the Governments would pledge itself to respect the territorial integrity of French Indochina and, in the event that there should develop a threat to the territorial integrity of Indochina, to enter into immediate consultation with a view to taking such measures as may be deemed necessary and advisable to meet the threat in question.Such agreement would also ensure that each of the Governments party to the agreement would not seek or accept preferential treatment in its trade or economic relations with Indochina and would use its influence to obtain for each of the signatories equality of treatment in trade and commerce with French Indo-China.3.3.3.The Government of Japan will withdraw all military, naval, air and police forces from China and from Indo-China.4.4.4.The Government of the United States and the Government of Japan will not support-militarily, politically, economically-any Government or regime in China other than the national Government of the Republic of China with capital temporarily at Chungking.5.5.5.Both Governments will give up all extraterritorial rights in China, including rights and interests in and with regard to international settlements and concessions, and rights under the Boxer Protocol of 1901.[Source: Hull, C.

It was also to that end that in September last year Japan concluded the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy.However, both the United States and Great Britain have resorted to every possible measure to assist the Chungking regime so as to obstruct the establishment of a general peace between Japan and China, interfering with Japan's constructive endeavours toward the stabilization of East Asia. Exerting pressure on the Netherlands East Indies, or menacing French Indo-China, they have attempted to frustrate Japan's aspiration to the ideal of common prosperity in cooperation with these regimes.…Furthermore, when Japan in accordance with its protocol with France took measures of joint defense of French Indo-China, both American and British Governments, willfully misinterpreting it as a threat to their own possessions, and inducing the Netherlands Government to follow suit, they enforced the assets freezing order, thus severing economic relations with Japan. While manifesting an obviously hostile attitude, these countries have strengthened their military preparations, perfecting an encirclement of Japan, and have brought about a situation which endangers the very existence of the Empire.…It is impossible not to reach the conclusion that the American Government desires to maintain and strengthen, in coalition with Great Britain and other Powers, its dominant position in has hitherto occupied not only in China but in other areas of East Asia. It is a fact of history that the countries of East Asia have for the past two hundred years or more have been compelled to observe the status quo under the Anglo- American policy of imperialistic exploitation and to sacrifice themselves to the prosperity of the two nations. The Japanese Government cannot tolerate the perpetuation of such a situation since it directly runs counter to Japan's fundamental policy to enable all nations to enjoy each its proper place in the world.…All the items demanded of Japan by the American Government regarding China such as wholesale evacuation of troops or unconditional application of the principle of non-discrimination in international commerce ignored the actual conditions of China, and are calculated to destroy Japan's position as the stabilizing factor of East Asia. The attitude of the American Government in demanding Japan not to support militarily, politically or economically any regime other than the regime at Chungking, disregarding thereby the existence of the Nanking Government, shatters the very basis of the present negotiations.[Source: Unknown (1941, December 13).Japanese Note to the United States December 7, 1941.The Avalon Project.

A year later, he published a book further developing his ideas for liberating Asians from European domination and expelling the“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“white race bloc” suppressing Asia's destiny. By 1941, creating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere had become the publicly articulated objective of Japan's Asian aggression, and it remained so until Japan's defeat in 1945.Eventually, finding themselves in a stalemate in China and needing more natural resources to sustain the war and the goal of creating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese military and civilian governments began to consider a thrust into Southeast Asia. Such a move would inevitably mean a confrontation with the United States and its colony the Philippines. Japan conceived a desperately hopeful plan of war against the United States and an initial knockout strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.[Source: Kordas, A.; Lynch, R.; Nelson, B.

The Japanese Government made several decisions during these two years that exacerbated the situation. Unable or unwilling to control the military, Japan's political leaders sought greater security by establishing the“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” in August, 1940. In so doing they announced Japan's intention to drive the Western imperialist nations from Asia. However, this Japanese-led project aimed to enhance Japan' economic and material wealth so that it would not be dependent upon supplies from the West, and not to“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“liberate” the long-subject peoples of Asia. In fact, Japan would have to launch a campaign of military conquest and rule, and did not intend to pull out of China. At the same time, several pacts with Western nations only made Japan appear more of a threat to the United States. First, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy on September 27, 1940 and thereby linked the conflicts in Europe and Asia. This made China a potential ally in the global fight against fascism. Then in mid-1941, Japan signed a Neutrality Pact with the Soviet Union, making it clear that Japan's military would be moving into Southeast Asia, where the United States had greater interests. A third agreement with Vichy France enabled Japanese forces to move into Indochina and begin their Southern Advance. The United States responded to this growing threat by temporarily halting negotiations with Japanese diplomats, instituting a full embargo on exports to Japan, freezing Japanese assets in U.S. banks, and sending supplies into China along the Burma Road. (...)Faced with serious shortages as a result of the embargo, unable to retreat, and convinced that the U.S. officials opposed further negotiations, Japan's leaders came to the conclusion that they had to act swiftly. For their part, U.S. leaders had not given up on a negotiated settlement, and also doubted that Japan had the military strength to attack the U.S. territory. Therefore they were stunned when the unthinkable happened and Japanese planes bombed the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.[Source:Japan, China, the United States and the Road to Pearl Harbor, 1937-41.

Komatsu was sent by the Japanese government to the US, tasked with explaining Japanese actions in Manchuria.It is true that Czarist Russia no longer exists, but to Japan the passing of the despotic government of the Czar has brought upon its wake a cause for even greater anxiety. For just beyond Manchuria, there exists a state, upholding the principles utterly incompatible with our ideal of government, social order, and human relationship. That state is vigorously pushing forward its programs and projects, and the energy and effectiveness that have been displayed cannot fail to sound the alarm in the minds of the thoughtful peoples of the other nations: We must again emphasize that Japan has a most vital concern in the affairs of Manchuria.Such being the position of Japan, it will not be difficult to understand why Japan has no territorial designs upon Manchuria. (...) As our land is poor in natural resources, it is necessary to see abroad for sources of food supply to feed our great population and this must be paid for by the fruits of our industries and commercial enterprises. In Manchuria, developed and cooperative effort of the peoples of China and Japan and of other nations, we shall find not only a source of food supply and raw material but also a profitable market for our manufactured goods.(...) The Chinese Nationalist Government has adopted a determined policy of depriving Japan of all her interests and properties in Manchuria by ignoring treaties and international agreements. (...) Every means conceivable has been utilized to imprint upon the minds of the masses a picture of Japan as the arch-enemy of China. The result has been the Chinese assault upon Japanese civilians and Korean farmers, the attacks upon the railway lines, the murder of Japanese officers, and other incidents of similar nature.(...) Strangely enough, Japan has been made to appear to the outside world as committing underhanded actions of aggression. (...) The actions taken by Japan are no more than the measures of self-defense. Confronted with a like situation I am sure that the United States would resort to similar means...The object of the Japanese operations has been to bring order out of chaos and there is no intention whatsoever of waging a war against China.[Source: Komatsu, T.

The vision of a China, unified, strong and hostile, a nation of four hundred millions, dominant in Manchuria and in East Asia, is disturbing to many Japanese.

Fundamental, therefore, among the interests of Japan in Manchuria is the strategic importance of this territory. (...)The dissatisfaction of the army; the financial policy of the Government; the appearance of a new political force emanating from the army, the country districts and the nationalist youth, which expressed dissatisfaction with all political parties, which despised the compromise methods of Western civilization and relied on the virtues of Old Japan and which included in its condemnation the self-seeking methods whether of financiers or politicians; the fall in commodity prices, which included primary producer to look to an adventurous foreign policy for the alleviation of his lot; the trade depression, which caused the industrial and commercial community to believe that better business would result from a more vigorous foreign policy: all these factors were preparing the way for the abandonment of the [Baron Kijūrō] Sidehara“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“policy of conciliation\" with China which seemed to have achieved such meager results.

Henderson has been described by historians as a supporter of appeasement.It is no exaggeration to say that the world is awaiting with anxiety the message which Hitler has to deliver at Nuremberg. He cannot get out of delivering it: that must be realised. The anxiety is no less great in Germany than elsewhere. And dictators can & must speak more clearly than the leaders of a democracy, that is why I have been pressing these last weeks for a clarification before Nuremberg of the situation at Prague. Benes (President of Czechoslovakia) will never go far enough till he is made to do so: & the whole of the Carlsbad points is better than any terms he is likely to get later, war or no war.I suppose the chances of Hitler coming out at Nuremberg with what will amount to peace or what will amount to war (thunder there is sure to be) are about 50-50.  I opt for the former.  If I am right I do wish it might be possible to get at any rate the Times, Camrose (Owner of the Daily Telegraph), Beaverbrook (Owner of Daily Express) Press etc to write up Hitler as an apostle of Peace.  It will be terribly shortsighted if this is not done.  Cannot the News Dept help?We make a great mistake when our Press persists in abusing him.  Let it abuse his evil advisers but give him a chance of being a good boy.  If our object is to achieve results that is the only line to take.  If our only satisfaction is to slang him, then we must abandon hope of ever getting results.[Source: Henderson, Nevile. (6 September 1938)European situation: Sudeten-German problem.

If only one is addressed, award a maximum oftwomarks.Origin, purpose and content must all be referenced at some point in the response (either as a value, limitation or both) to receive the fullfourmarks.For value, any combination of the following:The source's origin is valuable because it comes from Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, who had direct contact with Nazi officials and firsthand insight into British-German relations. His position allows historians to understand the perspectives and recommendations of a senior diplomat actively involved in Britains policy of appeasement.The purpose of the source, to advise the British government on handling Hitler through positive media portrayal, provides valuable insight into the strategies employed in appeasement. It reveals a preference for influencing Hitler diplomatically rather than through confrontation, which is crucial for understanding British efforts to avoid war.The content of the source, suggesting that the British press avoid criticizing Hitler and instead focus on presenting him positively, is valuable as it captures the British diplomatic mindset at the time. It illustrates the hope that diplomatic gestures might encourage Hitler toward peace, offering insight into appeasement strategies.For limitations, any combination of the following:As an ambassador, Henderson's perspective may reflect his personal biases and diplomatic objectives, which could skew his assessment. His views might not represent the entire British government's stance, making it a limited source for understanding broader British policy beyond his own pro-appeasement viewpoint.The purpose is also a limitation, as it reflects an attempt to sway government and press strategy rather than an objective analysis of Hitler's intentions. Henderson's goal to portray Hitler as a potential“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“apostle of Peace\" may reveal wishful thinking rather than a realistic assessment, thus potentially misrepresenting the Nazi threat.The content is limited as it reflects only Henderson's optimistic perspective on influencing Hitler through appeasement. His suggestion to avoid criticizing Hitler directly may overlook the true extent of Hitler's aggression, thus potentially downplaying the risks of appeasement for contemporary historians.[4 marks maximum]Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:The origin of this source, written by Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, is valuable because Henderson had firsthand experience with Nazi officials and was deeply involved in British-German relations. His perspective provides a unique window into the British diplomatic approach at the time, especially as he was a senior figure actively trying to influence the course of events (✓\\checkmark✓VO). The purpose of the document—to recommend that the British press portray Hitler positively—reveals a strategic attempt to use media as a tool to steer Hitler toward peace, offering insight into the broader rationale behind appeasement policies (✓\\checkmark✓VP). Furthermore, the content, which suggests avoiding direct criticism of Hitler and instead presenting him as an“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“apostle of Peace,” reflects British hopes that diplomacy and public messaging might discourage Nazi aggression, shedding light on Britain's cautious approach during this period (✓\\checkmark✓VC).However, the source has limitations due to its origin, as Henderson's personal position and pro-appeasement stance may color his views, meaning this source might not fully represent other, perhaps more skeptical, voices within the British government (✓\\checkmark✓LO). The purpose of advising the government to use the press to influence Hitler could be seen as overly optimistic, as it reflects Henderson's belief that media portrayal could sway Hitler's actions, which might not align with the reality of Hitler's ambitions (✓\\checkmark✓LP). Lastly, the content's suggestion to avoid criticizing Hitler directly could underestimate the true threat of Nazi Germany, as Henderson's approach may reflect wishful thinking about Hitler's potential for peace rather than a realistic assessment, thereby presenting a potentially misleading view of the risks of appeasement (✓\\checkmark✓LC).",

The negotiations from January to May, 1936, were a repetition of those of November and December, 1935. The object in each case was to eliminate the risk of European war by preventing effective action against Italy, and the method employed was to side-track sanctions by holding out the hope of“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“peace by conciliation.\" This technique, which had succeeded so well before Christmas, was equally efficacious in the new year and it was still being practised with great dexterity when the termination of the war by a complete Italian victory rewarded the virtuosity of the diplomats and won them a hard-earned rest.During this second phase the task of those who were playing for safety was relatively easy. For the rejection of the Hoare-Laval Plan, which was a victory for the sanctionists, was also the high-water mark of their success. They were unable to follow it up and thenceforth were fighting a losing battle. There were only a small number of people actively conducting the campaign and they depended for support on the large mass of middle opinion, whose influence, although invariably decisive when it operates, is only sporadically exercised. This“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“floating vote,\" as it is sometimes called, represents the millions of liberal-minded and sentimental English people, who subscribe neither to conservatism or socialism, but who must be captured by any party which aspires to power. At the General Election in November 1935, the“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“floating vote\" had been cast for the National Government, largely as a reward for its support of the League. In December it swung violently away and forced the Government to repudiate the Hoare-Laval plan and its author. Logically it should have continued to exert pressure in favour of more and better sanctions. But the 'floating vote' is anything but logical; it is emotional, and intellectually lazy, and likes to be bothered with politics as little as possible. It had spent its emotional force in a nation-wide protest; having done that it was quite content to let the Government carry on and do what it thought best about Abyssinia. Its conscience was salved, and it was beginning to be bored with the whole affair.[Martelli, George (1938).Italy Against The World; the first complete impartial account of Italy's repudiation of the League; her conquest of Abyssinia, by an English author with an intimate knowledge of the facts.

The broad conclusions of this Note may be summarized as follows :-(a) A German absorption of Czechoslovakia will enhance her military prestige, increase her war potential and probably enable her to dispose of stronger land forces against France and ourselves than she can do at present.(b) So far as air power is concerned, Germany may be able to maintain her lead over the Franco-British Air Forces in air striking power.  On the other hand, it is open to us, provided that we make the necessary effort, to catch her up, or at least greatly reduce her lead, in the matter of defence (both active and passive) against air attack.  By so doing we shall have heavily insured ourselves against the greatest danger to which we are present exposed: indeed by substantially reducing Germany’s only chance of a rapid decision, we shall have provided a strong deterrent against her making the attempt.(c) It follows, therefore, that, from the military point of view, time is in our favour, and that, if war with Germany has to come, it would be better to fight her in say 6-12 months' time, than to accept the present challenge.[Source: Ismay, H.

The article seeks to justify Chamberlain's appeasement policy.As a central figure in British politics during a tumultuous decade—first as Chancellor of the British Exchequer from 1931-1937, then as Prime Minister—Chamberlain had to address a complex of problems that reached well beyond a revived Germany and a ranting dictator. Britain faced threats across the globe: Germany in Europe, Italy in the Mediterranean, and, perhaps most troubling of all, Japan in Asia and the Pacific. A war with any one of those three surely would lead the other two to horn in on British territories or possessions. Notions that Chamberlain did not comprehend the threat Germany posed or that appeasement constituted moral cowardice on his part or that Winston Churchill was the only figure on Britain’s political scene calling for rearmament and a hard line against Hitler—all standard to the anti-Chamberlain dossier—oversimplify history to the point of falsity.In the late 1930s, just about every important figure in British government, and/or at least the Conservative Party, knew that it was time to spend on national defense. In November 1933, 10 months after Hitler seized power, the British cabinet created a committee on defense requirements to study the cost of military modernization and how long the process would take. That planning culminated in early 1935 in a“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“White Paper.” The findings? Even if rearmament began immediately, Britain would not be ready to fight Germany until 1939. The analysis described weapons not yet in production, some of them only prototype sketches. The“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“Thirty-Niners,” as rearmament advocates were called, realized wishes took time to become reality, and that until then the thing to do was negotiate, buy time, and avoid a new war. And so, from 1935 on, Britain was in a juggling act: trying to appease Hitler, but also feverishly girding for an inevitable war. In that context, Chamberlain's much-maligned policy, distasteful as it appears, made some sense. Engaging Hitler in talks and turning a cheek to his invective gained Britain time to man up. Chamberlain probably did feel his actions might make war unnecessary, and even if he failed he could say—as he did on September 1, 1939—that he acted“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“with a clear conscience.”By then Britain was ready to fight—or at least far readier than a year before.“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“Last September we might have lost a short war,” Lieutenant General Henry Pownall, the army's chief planner, wrote at the time. “Now we shouldn't, nor a long one either.”[Source: Citino, R.

Source 2 mentions that Britain would benefit from a delay of 6-12 months to improve defenses against Germany's air power. Similarly, Source 3 emphasizes that Britain was targeting 1939 for readiness, as rearmament took years to reach effective levels..Each source acknowledges the military danger posed by Germany. Source 2 discusses Germany’s potential to enhance its power and threaten France and Britain directly, while Source 3 indicates that British leaders viewed Germany as part of a global threat matrix that required careful attention.Both sources suggest that rearmament was tied to appeasement. In Source 2, military buildup is linked to buying time against a possible German attack, while Source 3 indicates that appeasement was seen as a way to delay conflict until Britain was ready to confront Germany militarily.For contrast, any of the following differences:Source 2 views delaying a confrontation with Germany as a short-term tactic, suggesting a 6-12 month window for Britain to strengthen defenses. In contrast, Source 3 presents appeasement as a longer-term approach to buy time until full readiness by 1939, considering it necessary due to global commitments.Source 2 focuses narrowly on the immediate military threat posed by Germany and specifically discusses the impact of Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia on European security. Source 3, however, discusses Britain's broader geopolitical challenges, including threats from Italy and Japan, showing that British priorities extended beyond Europe.Source 2 does not mention Chamberlain directly, nor does it justify appeasement; it primarily discusses the military advantages of postponing conflict. In contrast, Source 3 explicitly defends Chamberlain's policy, arguing that his approach made sense given Britain's military limitations and that he was actively preparing Britain for a likely war.[6 marks maximum]Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:Both sources highlight that time was essential for Britain to build up its military strength before any possible conflict with Germany (✓\\checkmark✓similarity). In Source A, there's an emphasis on the benefit of even a short delay, suggesting that an additional 6-12 months would help Britain catch up in air defenses against Germany. Similarly, Source B reflects the need for time, indicating that Britain required several years of preparation to reach a state of readiness by 1939 (✓\\checkmark✓evidence) Additionally, both sources show a shared understanding that Germany posed a serious threat to Britain (✓\\checkmark✓similarity). Source A underscores the risk of Germany gaining a stronger military foothold in Europe, while Source B situates Germany as part of a broader set of threats facing Britain, reflecting a recognition of the country's growing danger (✓\\checkmark✓evidence).However, the sources differ in how they view the role of appeasement. Source 2 presents delay as a short-term, tactical response to give Britain some additional time, while Source 3 depicts appeasement as a longer-term strategy to strengthen British defenses over multiple years, aiming for sustained readiness by 1939 (✓\\checkmark✓difference✓\\checkmark✓evidence). Another difference lies in the scope of threats each source addresses. Source 2 is focused on Germany's actions in Europe, particularly in Czechoslovakia, as a primary concern. In contrast, Source 3 places Germany within a global context, showing that British officials were also concerned with threats from Italy and Japan, which required careful balancing of resources across multiple regions (✓\\checkmark✓difference✓\\checkmark✓evidence).",

This provided fascist leaders with confirmation that their expansionism would likely not be challenged.Failure of disarmament:League’s disarmament initiatives failed, such as at the 1932-33 Disarmament Conference.

A second failure of the League of Nations in the 1930s was its weak response to the Abyssinian Crisis.

This British action condoned the violation of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and officially permitted German rearmament (✓\\checkmark✓). The lack of response from Britain (and France) when Hitler sent troops to take over Austria in March 1938, resulted in acceptance of Anschluss that was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. This gave Hiter the confidence to expand into Czechoslovakia next and increased his demands for Sudetenland, the German speaking area of Czechoslovakia (✓\\checkmark✓). The  highlight of the appeasement policy was the signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938, permitting Hiter to occupy the Sudeten area of Czechoslovakia.

Then the British government entered on its policy of reprimanding Mussolini severely, but the words were not followed by acts.In summing up the Abyssinian story it must be stated that neither Britain nor France was ignorant of the ultimate aims of Mussolini; yet they not only did nothing to help Abyssinia, but rather prevented her from acquiring the necessary arms for defense, in the hope that Mussolini's friendship could thus be bought. He was assisted, also, by the long diplomatic conferences which he knew meant nothing. To be sure, at one time he feared that public opinion in England might demand the closing of the Suez Canal, but he need not have worried, since the British government had no intention of hindering him. The sanctions passed by the League were not carried out. Oil sanctions were solemnly discussed by various committees of nineteen and thirteen and committees of experts, but Mussolini threatened that if an oil embargo were declared he would fight. Just how he could have dared fight Britain and France and the other League members combined was never explained, but the bluff worked. No oil embargo was ever declared on Mussolini. By use of gas and airplanes against a practically unarmed people Mussolini was able to subdue the Abyssinian nation which fought desperately to retain its independence. The abortive sanctions and the reprimands of the British government and press were deeply resented by Mussolini who has never forgotten these“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“insults\" to Italian honor.On May 2, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie left Abyssinia and the Italians announced that they had obtained another great addition to their colonial empire.

On July 31, 1935, two months before Italian troops invaded Ethiopia, he wrote in the Popolo d'Italia that“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“the Italian-Ethiopian problem admitted of only one solution-with Geneva, without Geneva, against Geneva.\" On the very day that Italian soldiers crossed the Ethiopian frontiers, Baron Aloisi declared in Geneva that Italy acted in defense against Ethiopian aggression, and that Ethiopia was therefore guilty of a breach of the Covenant, and not Italy.When it seemed for a time that the League was serious about stopping Italy from continuing her war of conquest and began to impose sanctions against Italy, Mussolini wrote in the Popolo d'Italia of January 31, 1936, that“\\text{\\textquotedblleft}“If the satanic oppression of the imperialists and of the bloodthirsty sects of Europe have their own way, Europe will inevitably fall into the most unjustified and terrible war that humanity has ever seen.\"In these words the fear of resolute League action was still discernible. The sanctions, however, proved ineffective because the League did not dare to impose the only sanction, the oil embargo, which would have brought the Fascist government to reason. Mussolini threatened that Italy would leave the League if it dared to execute faithfully the provisions of the Covenant, and the League backed down.
