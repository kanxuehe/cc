In the mRNA, these bases will be matched with their complementary base pair, so that the percentage value in the cytosine row will be the same as the percentage of guanine, so X = 25.2%. Likewise, Y will be the cytosine percentage (21.4%). Z is 0%, as there are no thymine bases found in mRNA, only uracil.Choice Ais not correct because even though X and Y are showing the right percentages, Z is incorrect as it is showing the percentage of uracil, not thymine.Choice Bis not correct because the percentages shown are for the DNA not for the complementary base pair of that base (which would be found in the mRNA), Z is also incorrect as it is showing the percentage of uracil, not thymine.Choice Dis not correct because the percentages shown are for the DNA not for the complementary base pair of that base (which would be found in the mRNA).",

If proteins, rather than DNA, had been the genetic material transferred to bacteria, the bacteria would have contained35S (the radiolabel in proteins) and not32P (the radiolabel in DNA). Therefore, Hershey and Chase would have observed a high proportion of35S in the bacterial pellet relative to the supernatant.A high proportion of32P in the bacterial pellet relative to the supernatant (Choice B) indicates that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material. Hershey and Chase did not grow bacteria in the presence of both isotopes at the same time and so could not have observed either a higher (Choice C) or lower (Choice D) proportion of both35S and32P in the bacterial pellet relative to the supernatant.",

At the melting point, the DNA double helix separates into two individual strands.Two DNA samples were compared, one consisting of only PQ pairs and another one consisting of only RS pairs.  Letters P, Q, R and S represent different nitrogenous bases found in the DNA.\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/d59dd324-98c9-4e4e-91b6-758d5679701c/images/0881eea3-e69e-45cc-ad3b-7c9e377763b5/BI0321.png)\n\n[ © Revision Village 2022]Based on the results presented in the graph, and your knowledge of nucleotide base pairing (between purines and pyrimidines), deduce which nitrogenous bases correspond to the letters P, Q, R and S.\\hspace{2.5em}P\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{2.5em}Q\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{2.5em}R\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{2.5em}S\\hspace{2.5em}\\hspace{1.5em}A.\\hspace{1.5em}CytosineGuanineThymineAdenine\\hspace{1.5em}B.\\hspace{1.5em}AdenineCytosineGuanineThymine\\hspace{1.5em}C.\\hspace{1.5em}GuanineAdenineThymineCytosine\\hspace{1.5em}D.\\hspace{1.5em}ThymineAdenineCytosineGuanine",

Hence, PQ or RS would either be adenine with thymine or cytosine with guanine (Choices AandD), but definitely notChoices BorC.Cytosine and guanine pairing has three hydrogen bonds, whereas the adenine and thymine pairing has only two hydrogen bonds. At95oC95^oC95oC, there is a smaller percentage of RS-rich DNA melted content compared to PQ-rich DNA.This shows that RS would be cytosine and guanine pairing (Choice D) and PQ is adenine and thymine. Because the extra hydrogen bond between C and G makes it more temperature resistant compared to A and T.",
