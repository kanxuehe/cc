      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Multicellular organisms are comprised of numerous specialised cells, enabling them to achieve larger sizes compared to unicellular organisms. This results in them needing exchange systems, such as the circulatory and respiratory systems, to manage waste removal and to acquire essential substances such as oxygen and nutrients. In contrast, unicellular organisms can rely on simple diffusion.Choice Cis correct.Choice Ais incorrect because although multicellular organisms often have a larger body size than unicellular organisms, this can be advantageous to them.Choice Bis incorrect, as multicellular organisms adapting to their environment more easily is an advantage.Choice Dis incorrect, as cell differentiation, where cells become specialised for specific functions, is an advantage as it allows for the division of labour amongst cells.",

Since photosynthesis takes place within chloroplasts, these cells contain a high density of chloroplasts They also contain a large central vacuole, which occupies the space at the center of the cell and helps maintain the turgor pressure in the cell. The position of the central vacuole ensures the chloroplasts will be pushed near the edges of the cell, where they can receive light. Additionally, the vacuole acts as a storage reservoir for water and other nutrients needed for photosynthesis.Choice AandChoice Dare incorrect because mitochondria are the site of aerobic respiration, during which carbohydrates are broken down to produce ATP.Choice Dis also incorrect as the Golgi apparatus packages proteins, not carbohydrates, for export, soChoice Bis also incorrect.",

Fluorescent dyes or antibodies emit specific wavelengths of light, highlighting target molecules, but they do not provide detailed structural information about proteins.Choice Dis incorrect because immunofluorescence identifies specific proteins in cells or tissues using fluorescently tagged antibodies.

      "content": "A student, learning to use a microscope, observed a pollen grain under a microscope with a magnification of ×100. Using an eyepiece graticule, they measured the diameter of the pollen grain to be 25 divisions. At this magnification, 1 division on the eyepiece graticule equals 3μ\\muμm.

      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Statement Iis not true. Increasing the magnification will narrow the field of view. This is a common student mistake. As magnification increases, the observer is focusing on a smaller area, like zooming in with a camera.Statement IIis true. The actual diameter of the pollen grain is calculated as 25 divisions × 3 µm/division = 75 µm.Statement IIIis true. If the magnification were increased by switching to a higher power objective, the same number of eyepiece graticule divisions would span a smaller actual distance on the specimen.Choice Cis correct because it contains the proper combination ofStatement IIandStatement III.Choice A, Choice BandChoice Ddo not contain the proper combination of statements.",
