The new bridge is expected to significantly ease road congestion, reducing travel times, especially for the many Canadians who commute daily to Detroit for work.

      "content": "Explain why, for an economy operating at a point on its production possibilities curve (PPC), choices about what to produce might be necessary.",
      "markScheme": "$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nWhen an economy operates along its production possibilities curve (PPC), it faces fundamental choices about how to allocate its limited resources to produce various goods and services. The scarcity of resources—land, labour, capital, and technology—prevents the production of unlimited quantities of goods and services . If these resources are fully employed, the production of more goods or services implies sacrificing the production of other goods and services $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nThe PPC illustrates the maximum output combinations of two goods that an economy can achieve using its available resources efficiently $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. If it operates inside the PPC, it indicates the underutilization of resources. An economy utilising all of its resources efficiently $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ produces at a point on the PPC $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.  Every choice along the PPC involves opportunity costs, which represent the value of the next best alternative that is forgone. If an economy decides to produce more of one good, it must reduce the production of another good $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In other words, there is a trade-off between the production of the two goods or services included in the model if resources are used efficiently.  For example, increasing the production of healthcare may mean sacrificing some units of education:\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/641ebfa6-e959-45e7-bb5c-4d85e848d48d/images/2f9dcb71-b726-4004-9844-7f9ab74d4cce/EC0682A.png)\n\n\nIf an economy producing at point A wants to provide more education services, it must produce at point B; doing so involves an opportunity cost—2 fewer units of health care services will be supplied $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\nIn summary, the decision regarding which point to produce on the PPC is vital due to the scarcity of resources and the inherent trade-offs involved when there is full employment of resources.

Injections are investment, government spending, and spending on exports $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$, and leakages are savings, taxes, and spending on imports $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nThe following diagram illustrates this model adding the leakages and injections.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/b168ff7e-e178-4d9c-bf54-65e7d523f842/images/91393d4e-4321-4ea5-9c4e-90ab5ada9822/EC0683.docx%20(1).jpg)\n\n\nBased on the diagram above, it is evident that if the leakages are greater than the injections, the size of the circular flow becomes smaller $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ and if injections are larger than leakages the size of the circular flow of income increases $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\nSavings leak out of the circular flow and after passing through the financial markets are injected back as investment.
