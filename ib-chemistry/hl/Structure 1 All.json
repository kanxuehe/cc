      "markScheme": "AExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:A cooling curve tracks how a substance loses energy as temperature decreases. The sloped regions show cooling within a phase, where particles lose kinetic energy and the temperature falls. The flat regions represent phase changes, when temperature remains constant because the energy released is due to intermolecular forces being formed.The long plateau near78∘C78^\\circ\\text{C}78∘Ccorresponds to condensation. Gas particles must come close together and form many new intermolecular forces, releasing a large quantity of energy to the surroundings. The shorter plateau near−114∘C-114^\\circ\\text{C}−114∘Ccorresponds to freezing, where fewer forces are formed as the liquid arranges into the solid structure, so less energy is released.The enthalpy of vaporization and the enthalpy of fusion are positive values, because they describe the endothermic changes of melting and vaporizing. On a cooling curve, we see the reverse processes, condensation and freezing, which have the same magnitude of enthalpy change but the opposite sign. The enthalpy of vaporization is larger than the enthalpy of fusion.The sloped regions represent cooling within a single phase, where particles lose kinetic energy and the temperature falls. The gradient of the slope is inversely related to the specific heat capacity: a steeper slope means the substance cools more quickly and therefore has a lower heat capacity. For ethanol, the liquid section has a shallower slope than the gas section, showing that liquid ethanol has a higher heat capacity than the vapour.Only condensation and freezing are represented here.

Without this force, the protons would repel each other due to their positive charges.

This force is much weaker than the strong nuclear force but is crucial for maintaining atomic structure.

A successful recrystallization should therefore result in only a single spot remaining, at the same position as the pure dye. One chromatogram shows this clearly: before recrystallization two spots are present, but afterwards only one spot remains. This is consistent with the removal of the contaminant and the retention of the dye.By contrast, chromatograms that still display multiple spots after recrystallization show that impurities remain in the sample. A result with no visible spots suggests that the dye itself has been lost, while a chromatogram that continues to display both dye and contaminant indicates that separation was unsuccessful.This question is of medium difficulty because students must connect the theoretical purpose of recrystallization with the experimental evidence provided by chromatography.",

This value is a weighted average of the masses of chlorine's naturally occurring isotopes, based on their relative abundances. Since 35.45 is much closer to 35 than to 37, it suggests that the lighter isotope(X35X2235Cl)\\ce{(^{35}Cl)}(X35​X2235​Cl)is more abundant than the heavier one(X37X2237Cl).\\ce{(^{37}Cl)}.(X37​X2237​Cl).In fact, chlorine exists as approximately 75%(X35X2235Cl)\\ce{(^{35}Cl)}(X35​X2235​Cl)and 25%(X37X2237Cl).\\ce{(^{37}Cl)}.(X37​X2237​Cl).Therefore, the correct mass spectrum must show two peaks atm/z=35m/z = 35m/z=35and 37, with the peak at 35 being roughly three times taller than the one at 37, matching the natural isotope distribution that results in a relative atomic mass of 35.45.",

Ethanol is more volatile than water and has a lower boiling point: it will vaporize at a lower temperature and can be collected by a condenser in a separate container.Recrystallizationis a purification method for solid substances. The impure solid is dissolved in a hot solvent, and upon cooling, pure crystals form while soluble impurities remain in the filtrateEvaporationis used to recover a dissolved solid by removing all of the liquid solvent.In this case, ethanol and water are both liquids that have different boiling points.

      "markScheme": "BExplanation:‾\\textrm{\\underline{Explanation:}}Explanation:​Dark lines in an absorption spectrum are caused by electrons in atoms absorbing photons of specific energies. These energies correspond to the difference between allowed energy levels in the atom. When atoms absorb those photons, the electrons are excited to higher energy levels, and the absorbed wavelengths are missing from the observed spectrum, creating dark lines.Some answers might seem tempting but are incorrect. For example, photons are not emitted when electrons are excited because energy must be absorbed for an electron to move to a higher level. Likewise, when electrons fall to lower energy levels, they emit photons, which is how emission spectra are formed. Suggesting that photons are absorbed while electrons fall is inaccurate, since falling to a lower energy level releases energy rather than requiring it.",

The residue on the filter paper contains sand and iron, while the sodium chloride solution passes through as the filtrate.To recover both water and sodium chloride from the filtrate, simple distillation is used. During distillation, water is collected as the distillate and sodium chloride remains in the flask. This ensures both components are obtained separately, which evaporation alone would not allow.Finally, the residue is separated into sand and iron by using a magnet, since iron filings are magnetic.

      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Successive ionization energies (IEn\\ce{IE}_nIEn​) always increase as electrons are removed from an increasingly positive ion and from orbitals of lower energy, so statement I is correct.Sodium has the ground−-−state configuration1s22s22p63s1.1s^2\\,2s^2\\,2p^6\\,3s^1.1s22s22p63s1.The largest jump for Na occurs when you cross from removing the valence electron to removing a core electron. For Na,IE1\\ce{IE}_1IE1​removes the3s3s3selectron;IE2\\ce{IE}_2IE2​begins removingn=2n=2n=2core electrons. Thus the big discontinuity is betweenIE1\\ce{IE}_1IE1​andIE2,\\ce{IE}_2,IE2​,(not betweenIE2\\ce{IE}_2IE2​andIE3.\\ce{IE}_3.IE3​.Statement II is incorrect.After nine electrons have been removed(IE1(\\ce{IE}_1(IE1​throughIE9),\\ce{IE}_9),IE9​),the remaining configuration is1s2.1s^2.1s2.The tenth ionization must remove a1s1s1selectron (crossing from then=2n=2n=2shell into then=1n=1n=1shell), which requires a dramatically larger energy. Therefore there is a second clear jump fromIE9\\ce{IE}_9IE9​toIE10,\\ce{IE}_{10},IE10​,so statement III is correct.This question is categorized as medium difficulty as students must be able to deduce the pattern for successive ionization energies of a given atom.",

An element's successive ionization energies increase as more energy is needed to remove electrons.  As the ion becomes more positive, it will take more energy to remove the next electron.  Successive ionization energies always increase. When the next electron is in a shell closer to the nucleus, the successive ionization energy will increase sharply because there is less shielding of the nuclear charge and because the distance between the electron and nucleus is smaller.In the table provided, the largest jump in the ionization energy for element X occurs betweenIE1IE_1IE1​(first ionization energy) andIE2IE_2IE2​(second ionization energy). This must correspond to a change in energy level. So, the atom of the element must have one valence electron and belong to group 1. In the case of Y, the largest jump in the ionization energy occurs betweenIE6IE_6IE6​(sixth ionization energy) andIE7IE_7IE7​(seventh ionization energy).

However, the data also show irregularities that can only be explained by sublevels. The first occurs between magnesium and aluminium: in aluminium, the electron removed is from a3p3p3porbital, which lies at slightly higher energy and is shielded by the inner 3s orbital. This makes it easier to remove than the3s3s3selectron in magnesium. A second dip occurs between phosphorus and sulfur. Phosphorus has three unpaired3p3p3pelectrons, but sulfur has a fourth3p3p3pelectron that must pair with one of the others. The repulsion between two electrons in the same orbital lowers the energy required to remove one, creating the observed decrease. These two dips are direct experimental evidence that period 3 contains both3s3s3sand3p3p3psublevels.Ar has highest effective nuclear charge , same shielding✓\\checkmark✓Further Explanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Further Explanation}}Further Explanation​:Argon lies at the end of period 3, where the nuclear charge is greatest.

This strong attraction between nucleus and outer3p3p3pelectrons requires much more energy to remove them, so argon shows the highest first ionization energy of period 3.",

In this process, the impure solid is dissolved in a hot solvent, and as the solution cools, the desired compound crystallizes out, leaving impurities behind in the solution. The purified crystals are then collected by filtration. This method works best when the desired compound is highly soluble in the solvent at high temperatures but only sparingly soluble at low temperatures, while the impurity remains dissolved in the solvent even at lower temperatures.Other techniques are less suitable in this case. Filtration would only be effective if the impurity were insoluble, which is not the case here. Evaporation would remove the solvent but leave behind both the solid and its impurities. Distillation is used to separate liquids based on boiling points and is not suitable for purifying a solid. Since recrystallization allows selective separation based on solubility differences, it is the best choice for purifying a solid contaminated with small amounts of a soluble impurity.",

      "markScheme": "BExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:In paper chromatography, a solvent rises through the paper by capillary action and carries the components of a mixture with it. Different substances travel at different rates depending on their interactions with the paper and the solvent, producing a pattern of separated spots. The position of each spot can be expressed using the retention factor:Rf=distance moved by the spotdistance moved by the solvent frontR_f = \\dfrac{\\text{distance moved by the spot}}{\\text{distance moved by the solvent front}}Rf​=distance moved by the solvent frontdistance moved by the spot​Retention factors range between 0 and 1 and provide a way to compare spots.In the chromatogram, the mixture has separated into four distinct spots. The sameRfR_fRf​value is seen in both the mixture and standard X, showing that X is present. Similarly, both spots of standard Y are also present in the mixture, so Y is included as well. Standard Z, however, has two spots not both present in the mixture, so Z is not included. Although four spots are visible in the mixture, this only proves that it contains at least four components—\\text{---}—some spots may still contain more than one substance. Therefore, Statements I and II are correct, and Statement III is not.This question is categorized as medium difficulty as students must recall how chromatography works and interpret results for a specific case.",

      "markScheme": "DExplanation:‾\\textrm{\\underline{Explanation:}}Explanation:​Isotopes have the same number of protons and electrons, meaning their chemical properties remain identical. This includes their ability to form chemical bonds and react with acids or bases. However, isotopes have different numbers of neutrons, leading to variations in their atomic mass which affects physical properties. In gases, the diffusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic mass (as described by Graham's Law). Lighter isotopes diffuse faster than heavier isotopes, making diffusion rate the key property that differs between isotopes.While some physical properties vary between isotopes, such as density and melting point, properties like electrical conductivity remain unchanged. Conductivity depends on the movement of free electrons, which is not influenced by the nuclear mass.",
