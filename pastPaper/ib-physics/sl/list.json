Friction acts along with the component of the normal force in the horizontal direction to produce the centripetal force. To account for this change, decreasing the speed will allow the car to require less frictional force due to a lower required centripetal acceleration and safely take the turn.\n\n\n- $\\dfrac{mv^2}{r}=\\mu mg$\n\nIncreasing the banking angle increases the component of the normal force that points towards the centre of the circle, providing more centripetal force to compensate for the loss in centripetal force contribution from friction.

So the answer is D.\nQualitatively, the total mass of the rocket is constantly decreasing due to the ejected fuel. As the fuel is ejected at a constant rate, there is a constant net force on the rocket. With a constant net force and decreasing mass, there will be an increasing acceleration. At the start, the change in mass will have little effect on the acceleration, but over time the effect of the decrease in mass will become more and more significant and result in greater and greater acceleration.",
