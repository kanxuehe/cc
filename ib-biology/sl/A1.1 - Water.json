      "markScheme": "CExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Statement Iis true because cohesion refers to the attraction between water molecules due to hydrogen bonding. This cohesive property allows the water column to behave as a continuous stream, enabling tension created by transpiration at the leaves to be transmitted all the way down the xylem. This is central to the cohesion-tension theory of water transport.Statement IIis false because cohesion actually resists evaporation. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules make it harder for individual molecules to escape into the air. Evaporation is more closely influenced by temperature and humidity, not directly by cohesion.Statement IIIis true because adhesion is the attraction between water molecules and the walls of the xylem vessel. This helps to counteract gravity and supports the column, reducing the chance of it breaking, especially under tension during transpiration. So this contributes to the integrity of the water column.Choice Cis therefore the correct answer because it only includes the two trueStatements IandIII.Choice Ais incorrect as it is missing the trueStatement III.Choices BandDare incorrect as they include the falseStatement II.",

      "markScheme": "BExplanation‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}Explanation​:Water's ability to dissolve biomolecules and, therefore, enabling them to interact (Statement II) would have been crucial to early cellular evolution. This property allows for the formation of a \"primordial soup,\" where simple organic molecules could interact, form more complex compounds, and eventually lead to the development of proto-cells.Choice Bis the correct answer to this question.While surface tension is a property of water, it does not directly contribute to the formation of proto-cell membranes (Statement I) in the context of early cellular evolution. Proto-cell membranes are primarily formed by the self-assembly of amphipathic molecules like phospholipids, which align themselves in a bilayer in water due to their hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.Organic molecules needed to remain in suspension for interactions, rather than settling quickly (Statement III). Water's density is well-suited for suspending organic particles, allowing them to remain available for biochemical reactions, while enabling gradual sedimentation over time.Choices A, CandDare incorrect as they include one or more untrue statements.",
