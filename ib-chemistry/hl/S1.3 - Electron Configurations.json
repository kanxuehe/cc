      "markScheme": "BExplanation:‾\\textrm{\\underline{Explanation:}}Explanation:​Dark lines in an absorption spectrum are caused by electrons in atoms absorbing photons of specific energies. These energies correspond to the difference between allowed energy levels in the atom. When atoms absorb those photons, the electrons are excited to higher energy levels, and the absorbed wavelengths are missing from the observed spectrum, creating dark lines.Some answers might seem tempting but are incorrect. For example, photons are not emitted when electrons are excited because energy must be absorbed for an electron to move to a higher level. Likewise, when electrons fall to lower energy levels, they emit photons, which is how emission spectra are formed. Suggesting that photons are absorbed while electrons fall is inaccurate, since falling to a lower energy level releases energy rather than requiring it.",

This makes it easier to remove than the3s3s3selectron in magnesium. A second dip occurs between phosphorus and sulfur. Phosphorus has three unpaired3p3p3pelectrons, but sulfur has a fourth3p3p3pelectron that must pair with one of the others.
