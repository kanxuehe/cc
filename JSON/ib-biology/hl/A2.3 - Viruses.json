Genetic recombination occurs when many strains of the virus infect the same host, and a new combination of genetic material is observed, which leads to changes in the virus (evolution) over time (Choice A).   Mutations occur rapidly in HIV because it is a single-stranded RNA virus and lacks a mechanism to proofread the genome. The introduction of this variation leads to evolution (Choice B). The genome of humans and the HIV host population, has high genetic diversity. Such diversity in the genome may provide a selective advantage for some HIV strains (Choice D).",

This DNA copy is then integrated into the host cell’s genome, allowing the virus to hijack the host's transcription and translation machinery to produce viral proteins and replicate itself.\nChoice A is incorrect because a DNA-containing virus would simply use the host cell’s replication mechanisms to replicate its DNA; there would be no need for reverse transcription.\nChoice C is incorrect because reverse transcription involves the conversion of RNA into DNA.\nChoice D is incorrect because, whilst the viral DNA copy does get incorporated into the host cell’s genome, this cannot be regarded as host cell DNA as it remains distinct from the host's original DNA.

However, HIV is a retrovirus and contains the enzyme reverse transcriptase, while the coronavirus does not contain reverse transcriptase ($\\checkmark$). Both viruses contain spikes ($\\checkmark$) for attachment to cells, and both HIV spikes and coronavirus spikes are made of glycoprotein ($\\checkmark$). HIV contains two single strands of RNA; however, the coronavirus contains one single strand of RNA ($\\checkmark$).\n\n\nA quality mark is awarded if each part of the question (a, b, c) is answered to earn at least half of the points available, answers do not require re-reading to be understood, and there are almost no errors and little irrelevant information. <span class=\"marks\">[1]</span>\n",

      "markScheme": "D\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$: \nChoice D is correct because integrase proteins are not required to enter the host cell; integrase proteins are needed to integrate viral genetic information into host DNA. All other answer options (Choice A, Choice B, and Choice C) are characteristics of HIV.",
