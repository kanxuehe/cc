      "markScheme": "$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nA non-price determinant of demand is any variable except for price that can influence demand $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. These determinants can lead to shifts of the demand curve either to the right (increase in demand) or to the left (decrease in demand), as opposed to a change in price that causes a movement along the D curve. One non-price determinant of demand is income $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In this case, demand is affected in different ways depending on whether the good is a normal good or an inferior good $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. As consumer income increases, the demand for normal goods (e.g., luxury items, and higher-quality products) typically rises. Conversely, if income decreases, demand for these goods usually falls $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. For inferior goods (e.g., generic brands, lower-quality products), demand increases as income decreases, and vice versa.\nThe following diagram shows how demand for potatoes decreases as income increases, as consumers start consuming more expensive vegetables as side-dishes $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.

Tastes and preferences refer to the individual consumer's likes, dislikes, and overall attitudes toward different goods and services.

      "content": "Explain how a natural disaster could lead to excess demand for basic goods.",
      "markScheme": "$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods, can damage production facilities, transportation infrastructure, and supply chains $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This disruption reduces the quantity of basic goods available in the market, creating scarcity $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In the aftermath of a disaster, consumers often fear shortages and may rush to stockpile essential items such as food, water, and medical supplies $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This sudden increase in demand can quickly outstrip the available supply, leading to excess demand. The combination of supply disruptions and panic-driven consumer behaviour can lead to a significant mismatch between the supply of basic goods and the heightened demand following a natural disaster, resulting in excess demand and shortages. Excess demand occurs when the price is set below equilibrium $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. This is so because prices take time to adjust and while prices are below the equilibrium, demand exceeds the quantity supplied $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Price may be below the equilibrium also because the government may intervene in the market preventing the rise of the staples prices in the aftermath of a natural disaster.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/ad389e8d-8cdd-43fb-a5d1-8375912aad3f/images/e5499e1f-90fa-4a63-9e86-f77854d8b02c/EC0686A.png)\n\n\nAs the diagram above shows, when demand increases, the previous equilibrium price ($\\ce{P_1}$) is below the new equilibrium price ($\\ce{P_2}$). Consequently, the $\\ce{Q_S}$  is lower than the $\\ce{Q_D}$ causing an excess demand or shortage equal to $\\ce{Q_D}$ - $\\ce{Q_S}$ $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This shortage will force P to increase up to the equilibrium price $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\nFurther reasons why there could be an excess demand after a natural disaster is that people may anticipate further disruptions or prolonged shortages, prompting them to buy more than they typically would. This heightened demand can contribute to excess demand even if the supply is only temporarily reduced.\nRetailers may face challenges in restocking goods quickly due to supply chain interruptions. If consumers perceive that certain goods are becoming scarce, they may increase their purchases, further intensifying demand.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using terms defining the excess demand by indicating that it occurs when price is set below the equilibrium.

      "markScheme": "$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nAn increase in the price of beef can have distinct effects on the supply of leather and the supply of poultry due to the concepts of joint supply and competitive supply. A change in the price of a related product is a non-price determinant of supply and will shift the supply curve of the product under consideration $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Competitive supply means that the output of one product prevents or limits the output of alternative products $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. Joint supply means that the supply of a product results in the supply of at least one by-product $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. This explains how the price of related goods can affect the supply of individual producers.\nIn the case of competitive supply, if a firm produces different products, a change in the price of one product may affect the output of another of its products because producers have limited resources so they cannot supply more of one product without producing less of the other products. Beef and poultry are in competitive supply $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$, so if the price of beef increases, the producer has more incentives to produce more beef and the amount of poultry produced will need to be reduced $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/14fcf616-0d20-4ccc-9d7e-c39398152f94/images/a7410515-6faf-43fa-825d-47a09717a4cd/EC0685.docx%20(3).jpg)\n\n\nWhen the price of beef increases, producers will increase the resources they use for beef production and the quantity of beef supplied will increase. The higher price of beef disincentivizes poultry production, which is in competitive supply with beef. The supply of poultry decreases ($\\ce{S_1}$ to $\\ce{S_2}$), increasing price and reducing the quantity demanded of poultry $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\nOn the contrary, beef and leather are in joint supply, because leather is a by-product of beef production $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. When a farm raises cows for beef, the hides from these cows can be processed into leather. If the price of beef increases, the farm will raise more cows and more leather will also be produced $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/14fcf616-0d20-4ccc-9d7e-c39398152f94/images/66c9e787-d200-4708-b77c-ef448dee61c2/EC0685.docx.jpg)\n\n\nWhen beef production increases in response to the higher price of beef, the supply of leather—a by-product of beef—also increases.

      "content": "Explain two functions of the price mechanism.",
      "markScheme": "$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nIn market economies, the price mechanism signals the value of a product to producers and consumers and helps ration scarce resources used in producing goods and services. The price mechanism refers to the interaction of demand and supply to set the equilibrium price in a market $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/3cfc594b-82a9-4a62-b0ab-5d1ea26b0fc2/images/be18c217-157f-4ea2-85c7-ab677f513465/image.png)\n\n\nThe signalling function $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ of the price mechanism is fundamental to resource allocation in a free-market economy. Prices efficiently allocate scarce resources by conveying information about the relative desirability and scarcity of goods and services in the market. Producers reallocate their productive resources to the products that have the highest prices.\nWhen the price is set at $P^*$, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal ($Q^*$). But if demand for the product increases ($D_1$ to $D_2$), its price rises ($P^*$ to $P_2$) $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$, signalling to producers that there is an increased desire for that item $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In response to higher prices, producers allocate more resources$\\text{\\textemdash}$such as labour, capital, and raw materials$\\text{\\textemdash}$to produce more of the product ($Q^*$ to $Q_2$) $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This dynamic adjustment ensures that society's limited resources are directed towards producing goods consumers value the most, promoting economic efficiency.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/3cfc594b-82a9-4a62-b0ab-5d1ea26b0fc2/images/6c51891e-6b47-4e76-806a-a1681178edca/image.png)\n\n\nThe price mechanism also has a rationing function $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. When an item becomes scarcer or more sought after, its price rises ($P_1$ to $P_2$). As the price increases, the quantity demanded falls ($Q_1$ to $Q_2$) according to the law of demand $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Those consumers with a higher willingness and ability to pay the higher price gain access to the product, while those who are less willing or able to do so may choose to forgo purchasing it or seek alternatives $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In this way, the price mechanism effectively rations the limited supply of the item among consumers.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the term price mechanism by indicating that it is the interaction of demand and supply in a market to set the equilibrium price ($\\checkmark$)\nFor correct usage of other relevant terms ($\\checkmark$)\n\n- e.g. rationing, allocate, incentive, equilibrium, scarcity, shortage, surplus, efficiency\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[2 maximum]</span>\n\n$\\textcolor{#056608}{\\textbf{Diagrams}\\ [\\textbf{D}]}$\nFor drawing a correctly labelled demand and supply diagram showing:\n\n- price increasing or decreasing ($\\checkmark$)\n- quantity supplied (or demanded) decreasing in response to price ($\\checkmark$)\n\nLinking the idea of the price mechanism to the diagram ($\\checkmark$)\n<span class=\"marks\">[3 maximum]</span>\n\n$\\textcolor{#1974D2}{\\textbf{Explanation}\\ [\\textbf{EX}]}$\nIncluding any two of:\nsignalling function, incentive function, or rationing function ($\\checkmark$)\n<span class=\"marks\">[1 maximum]</span>\n\nFor explaining two of (a-c):\n\n- Signalling function\n  \n  - changes in demand or supply affect equilibrium price ($\\checkmark$)\n  - increased prices signal producers to produce more of a good, or decreased prices signal producers to produce less of a good ($\\checkmark$)\n\n\nOR\n\n- Incentive function\n  \n  - changing prices incentivise consumers and producers to change the quantity they consume or produce ($\\checkmark$)\n  - consumers buy more or less to maximise utility, or producers produce more or less to maximise profit ($\\checkmark$)\n\n\nOR\n\n- Rationing function\n  \n  - increasing prices change the quantity demanded due to the law of demand, or vice versa ($\\checkmark$)\n  - when prices increase, only those willing and able to pay the higher price will obtain the product, or vice versa ($\\checkmark$)\n\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[4 maximum]</span>\n\n<span class=\"marks\">[<strong>= 10 maximum</strong>]</span>\n",

In this case, the 25-fold price increase indicated that this item was highly valuable to consumers, which drove producers to pause other productions to focus their resources on making face masks.

      "content": "Explain why increased demand for public goods may require increased government spending.",
      "markScheme": "$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nDemand is the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices over a given period of time, and public goods are a specific category of goods that are characterised by two main properties: they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. These characteristics lead to the free-rider problem: firms cannot charge a price for these goods because it is difficult or impossible to prevent individuals from using the good or service, even if they do not pay for it. Due to these characteristics, markets will not produce public goods, so they are usually produced by the government $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$.\nLike any other good, the demand for public goods may change due to non-price factors such as a change in the perceived personal and collective benefits of a public good $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. For instance, if people believe that a clean environment directly improves their quality of life, they may be more inclined to support environmental regulations and initiatives. A change in their perception could occur due to an awareness and information campaign about the benefits and necessity of a cleaner environment $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/0f90971f-4b50-4b17-a7cf-dd9d9d942b9a/images/bac33f92-0495-466e-9fc3-96274475a974/EC0656a1.docx.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe diagram shows that if the preference for a public good increases, the demand curve will shift to the right. If these goods had a price, the price would increase, and the quantity produced by the private market would also increase ($\\ce{Q_1}$ to $\\ce{Q_2}$) $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$. But in this case, the free-rider problem prevents the price from increasing, so the market will not produce more $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nIf private markets do not meet the increased demand for a good, the government may choose to provide these goods or to increase the amount they already provide $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Therefore, if the government increases its provision of a public good, its spending increases $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ from $\\ce{P_1 \\times Q_1}$ to $\\ce{P_2 \\times Q_2}$ $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly indicating that public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous goods that must be produced by the government: the market will not produce them.
