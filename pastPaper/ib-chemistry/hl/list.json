This allows a liquid to change its shape to fit its container while maintaining a fixed volume.  Since the particles remain in close contact, liquids are not compressible.  The particles do experience attractions to one aonther (intermolecular / interatomic forces) that must be overcome to enter into the gas phase.\n  The particles in a gas are in constant random motion, moving rabidly in all directions with negligible forces between them.

As kerosene is heated, its molecules absorb energy and move faster, increasing their kinetic energy.

The process involves heating the mixture until the more volatile liquid (the one with the lower boiling point) vaporizes, then condensing and collecting this vapor as the distillate. The less volatile component remains in the distillation flask.\nHere is the typical setup:\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/00dedc88-7e57-4767-96b3-881206963b72/images/8bca4d25-da81-4aca-91e2-e91a58ca3eea/unnamed%20(1).png)\n\n\r\n$\\footnotesize{\\textrm{[© Revision Village 2023. Created with Chemix (https://chemix.org)]}}$\nStatement II is incorrect because an evaporating basin is not used in distillation; the essential apparatus includes a distillation flask, a condenser, and a thermometer.\nStatement III is correct because propan$-$2$-$ol has more branching than propan$-$1$-$ol, leading to weaker intermolecular forces and therefore a lower boiling point. This means propan$-$2$-$ol vaporizes and is collected first as the distillate.\nThis question is of moderate difficulty since it requires both knowledge of distillation as a separation technique and an understanding of how molecular structure affects boiling points.",

Phosphorus (1012 kJ mol$^{-1}$) has a higher ionization energy than sulfur (1000 kJ/mol), despite sulfur being further right on the periodic table.\nTo understand this exception, we can consider the electron configuration for S,  $1s^2\\,2s^2\\,2p^6\\,3s^2\\,3p^4$, and P, $1s^2\\,2s^2\\,2p^6\\,3s^2\\,3p^3$.

    "markScheme": "B\n\n$\\textrm{\\underline{Explanation:}}$\nDark lines in an absorption spectrum are caused by electrons in atoms absorbing photons of specific energies. These energies correspond to the difference between allowed energy levels in the atom. When atoms absorb those photons, the electrons are excited to higher energy levels, and the absorbed wavelengths are missing from the observed spectrum, creating dark lines.\nSome answers might seem tempting but are incorrect. For example, photons are not emitted when electrons are excited because energy must be absorbed for an electron to move to a higher level. Likewise, when electrons fall to lower energy levels, they emit photons, which is how emission spectra are formed. Suggesting that photons are absorbed while electrons fall is inaccurate, since falling to a lower energy level releases energy rather than requiring it.",

    "markScheme": "C\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\nThe student must deduce the corresponding group of elements X and Y from the successive ionization energies given. An element's successive ionization energies increase as more energy is needed to remove electrons.  As the ion becomes more positive, it will take more energy to remove the next electron.  Successive ionization energies always increase. When the next electron is in a shell closer to the nucleus, the successive ionization energy will increase sharply because there is less shielding of the nuclear charge and because the distance between the electron and nucleus is smaller.\nIn the table provided, the largest jump in the ionization energy for element X occurs between $IE_1$ (first ionization energy) and $IE_2$ (second ionization energy). This must correspond to a change in energy level. So, the atom of the element must have one valence electron and belong to group 1. In the case of Y, the largest jump in the ionization energy occurs between $IE_6$ (sixth ionization energy) and $IE_7$ (seventh ionization energy). So, the atom of the element must have six valence electrons and belong to group 16.\nX forms cations with one positive charge whereas Y forms ions with two negative charges. As a result, the combination of $\\ce{X+}$ and $\\ce{Y^{2-}}$ is $\\ce{X2Y}.$\nThis question is categorized as a medium as the student must use the information from successive ionization energies to deduce the corresponding group for the elements and then figure out how these are combined together.",
