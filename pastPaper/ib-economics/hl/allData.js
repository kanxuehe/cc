      'Explain two limitations of the assumption of rational consumer choice.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nWhen looking at decision$-$making, we assume that consumers engage in rational consumer choice. These assumptions include the idea that consumers are consistent in their decision$-$making, they have perfect information when making decisions, and they will always seek to consume goods and services that maximise their utility $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. While these assumptions are helpful for developing economic theory and models, they have their limitations. Two examples of these limitations are the idea of bounded rationality and the presence of biases like the anchoring bias.\nOne key assumption of rational consumer choice is perfect information. Perfect information is the idea that consumers always have all available information about a good or service they wish to purchase. In practice, consumers are subject to bounded rationality $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. It would be too costly in terms of time, resources, or money to gather all the information a consumer needs to choose the good or service that maximises their utility. Even if these costs were not an issue, the human mind may be incapable of processing the volume of information that would be necessary to make the utility$-$maximising choice $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. These limitations mean that consumers are only rational up to a certain point $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Consumers instead tend to aim to make the choice they find the most satisfying, even if it is not the maximising choice $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nCognitive biases can also pose a challenge to the assumption of perfect information in consumer decision$-$making $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Availability bias, for example, refers to the tendency to rely on the most recent information available when making a decision $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Instead of fully examining all available information, decisions are made using the information that consumers most recently remember, and often, this information is considered more reliable than previous information even if there is nothing specific to indicate the information is any more trustworthy $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This implies that a consumer may make decisions based on what they most clearly remember, which may lead to choices that do not maximise utility $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the term rational consumer choice by indicating that consumers make choices based on the assumptions of consistency in taste and preferences, that they have perfect information, and seek to maximise their utility.

      'Using real-world examples, evaluate the effectiveness of choice architecture in correcting a market failure.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$:\nChoice architecture $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$ is a type of nudge that can be used to influence decision-making by framing options in such a way that certain behaviours can be either encouraged or discouraged. Since choice architecture can be used to influence choices, it can effectively be applied to address certain market failures $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. One area where choice architecture has been successfully applied is in organ donation.\nIn June 2023, Northern Ireland passed a law making all adults in the country potential organ donors by default unless they belong to an excluded group $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$. This is an example of default choice, a type of choice architecture in which a choice is made by doing nothing $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. The choice, in this case, is becoming a potential organ donor.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/8efca0e9-7907-4be2-b4e2-f1d094f3c45c/images/c197aee6-306f-4d4a-a770-fd632605cee0/EC0402%20fig3.png)\n\n\nAlthough many lives are saved through organ donation, a number of people die waiting for transplants as the demand for transplant organs ($Q_D$) exceeds the available supply ($Q_S$) $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$. The organ transplant market is also unique in that it typically does not rely on price to stimulate supply in order to avoid perverse incentives such as a black market for organ transplant sales $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/8efca0e9-7907-4be2-b4e2-f1d094f3c45c/images/a9ce918c-7631-4bb6-a56f-6bdcba089bd3/EC0402%20fig4.png)\n\n\nBy making organ donation the default choice for all adult citizens in Northern Ireland, the organs available for transplants increase from $S_1$ to $S_2$ $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$, which may minimise the number of patients who do not receive transplants $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nThis type of choice architecture is effective in this case because it represents a low-cost solution to the issue of long transplant lists [RWE]. Beyond the opportunity costs associated with informing the people of Northern Ireland of the change, the actual cost of implementing this type of choice architecture is minimal $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$. People are also generally in favour of organ donation but may forget to register as an organ donor, or they fail to inform their family members of their desire to donate their organs. By making the default choice opting-in, the process of registering and informing relatives is simpler $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$. Citizens also still maintain freedom of choice as they can choose to opt out of the program. However, the inconvenience of opting out may keep people who are indifferent about organ donation on the donor list, maintaining the increase in supply of available donors $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$.\nAlthough choice architecture is likely to be very effective in increasing organ donation, it may be ineffective on its own to discourage other behaviours $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$. An example of this is the market for cigarettes. The United Kingdom uses restricted choice to discourage the consumption of cigarettes, such as banning the display of tobacco products $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$. While keeping tobacco products out of sight may discourage some consumers from smoking, cigarettes are highly addictive and a mild inconvenience may not be enough to reduce consumption $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$. Unlike indirect taxes, choice architecture also does not have the advantage of generating tax revenue, which could be used to address the negative externalities that a product like cigarettes generates $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$. This is likely the reason why the UK government levies taxes on tobacco products in addition to the restricted choice interventions it uses $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$.\n\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the term $`$choice architecture\' by indicating that it relates to the idea of framing and designing environments in a way that influences decision-making.

A producer supplies more if the price of the commodity increases $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ as it is more profitable for the producer $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Hence, a rise in price ($P$ to $P_1$) leads to an upward movement along the supply curve from A to B $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$ which leads to an increase in quantity supplied ($Q$ to $Q_1$) keeping other factors constant.

These determinants can lead to shifts of the demand curve either to the right (increase in demand) or to the left (decrease in demand), as opposed to a change in price that causes a movement along the D curve. One non-price determinant of demand is income $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In this case, demand is affected in different ways depending on whether the good is a normal good or an inferior good $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. As consumer income increases, the demand for normal goods (e.g., luxury items, and higher-quality products) typically rises. Conversely, if income decreases, demand for these goods usually falls $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. For inferior goods (e.g., generic brands, lower-quality products), demand increases as income decreases, and vice versa.\nThe following diagram shows how demand for potatoes decreases as income increases, as consumers start consuming more expensive vegetables as side-dishes $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$. The quantity demanded of potatoes decreases from $\\ce{Q_1}$ to $\\ce{Q_2}$ and the D curve shifts leftwards.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/7a543eed-b331-4803-99e4-287443f556c0/images/21c5be84-5147-4293-8138-0f6a4022b147/EC0684A.png)\n\n\nAnother non-price determinant of demand is consumer tastes and preferences. Tastes and preferences refer to the individual consumer\'s likes, dislikes, and overall attitudes toward different goods and services. Trends, advertising, and social influences can make certain products more desirable, leading to increased demand for those goods $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nFor example, if leather clothes become very trendy, demand will increase $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$, as the following diagram shows.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/7a543eed-b331-4803-99e4-287443f556c0/images/a705417e-fa08-4161-9dec-dc464e1806a0/EC0684.docx.jpg)\n\n\nThe diagram shows how fashion increased the quantity demanded when the price is $\\ce{P_1}$ from $\\ce{Q_1}$ to $\\ce{Q_2}$: this is shown as a rightward shift of the D curve.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the terms defining non-price determinants of demand by indicating that these are any variable that can influence demand except for price.

      'Explain how a natural disaster could lead to excess demand for basic goods.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods, can damage production facilities, transportation infrastructure, and supply chains $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This disruption reduces the quantity of basic goods available in the market, creating scarcity $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In the aftermath of a disaster, consumers often fear shortages and may rush to stockpile essential items such as food, water, and medical supplies $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This sudden increase in demand can quickly outstrip the available supply, leading to excess demand. The combination of supply disruptions and panic-driven consumer behaviour can lead to a significant mismatch between the supply of basic goods and the heightened demand following a natural disaster, resulting in excess demand and shortages. Excess demand occurs when the price is set below equilibrium $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. This is so because prices take time to adjust and while prices are below the equilibrium, demand exceeds the quantity supplied $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Price may be below the equilibrium also because the government may intervene in the market preventing the rise of the staples prices in the aftermath of a natural disaster.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/ad389e8d-8cdd-43fb-a5d1-8375912aad3f/images/e5499e1f-90fa-4a63-9e86-f77854d8b02c/EC0686A.png)\n\n\nAs the diagram above shows, when demand increases, the previous equilibrium price ($\\ce{P_1}$) is below the new equilibrium price ($\\ce{P_2}$). Consequently, the $\\ce{Q_S}$  is lower than the $\\ce{Q_D}$ causing an excess demand or shortage equal to $\\ce{Q_D}$ - $\\ce{Q_S}$ $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This shortage will force P to increase up to the equilibrium price $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\nFurther reasons why there could be an excess demand after a natural disaster is that people may anticipate further disruptions or prolonged shortages, prompting them to buy more than they typically would. This heightened demand can contribute to excess demand even if the supply is only temporarily reduced.\nRetailers may face challenges in restocking goods quickly due to supply chain interruptions. If consumers perceive that certain goods are becoming scarce, they may increase their purchases, further intensifying demand.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using terms defining the excess demand by indicating that it occurs when price is set below the equilibrium.

      'Explain how an increase in the price of beef might affect the supply of leather and the supply of poultry.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nAn increase in the price of beef can have distinct effects on the supply of leather and the supply of poultry due to the concepts of joint supply and competitive supply. A change in the price of a related product is a non-price determinant of supply and will shift the supply curve of the product under consideration $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Competitive supply means that the output of one product prevents or limits the output of alternative products $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. Joint supply means that the supply of a product results in the supply of at least one by-product $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. This explains how the price of related goods can affect the supply of individual producers.\nIn the case of competitive supply, if a firm produces different products, a change in the price of one product may affect the output of another of its products because producers have limited resources so they cannot supply more of one product without producing less of the other products. Beef and poultry are in competitive supply $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$, so if the price of beef increases, the producer has more incentives to produce more beef and the amount of poultry produced will need to be reduced $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/14fcf616-0d20-4ccc-9d7e-c39398152f94/images/a7410515-6faf-43fa-825d-47a09717a4cd/EC0685.docx%20(3).jpg)\n\n\nWhen the price of beef increases, producers will increase the resources they use for beef production and the quantity of beef supplied will increase. The higher price of beef disincentivizes poultry production, which is in competitive supply with beef. The supply of poultry decreases ($\\ce{S_1}$ to $\\ce{S_2}$), increasing price and reducing the quantity demanded of poultry $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\nOn the contrary, beef and leather are in joint supply, because leather is a by-product of beef production $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. When a farm raises cows for beef, the hides from these cows can be processed into leather. If the price of beef increases, the farm will raise more cows and more leather will also be produced $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/14fcf616-0d20-4ccc-9d7e-c39398152f94/images/66c9e787-d200-4708-b77c-ef448dee61c2/EC0685.docx.jpg)\n\n\nWhen beef production increases in response to the higher price of beef, the supply of leather—a by-product of beef—also increases.

    content: 'Explain two functions of the price mechanism.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nIn market economies, the price mechanism signals the value of a product to producers and consumers and helps ration scarce resources used in producing goods and services. The price mechanism refers to the interaction of demand and supply to set the equilibrium price in a market $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/3cfc594b-82a9-4a62-b0ab-5d1ea26b0fc2/images/be18c217-157f-4ea2-85c7-ab677f513465/image.png)\n\n\nThe signalling function $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ of the price mechanism is fundamental to resource allocation in a free-market economy. Prices efficiently allocate scarce resources by conveying information about the relative desirability and scarcity of goods and services in the market. Producers reallocate their productive resources to the products that have the highest prices.\nWhen the price is set at $P^*$, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal ($Q^*$). But if demand for the product increases ($D_1$ to $D_2$), its price rises ($P^*$ to $P_2$) $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$, signalling to producers that there is an increased desire for that item $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In response to higher prices, producers allocate more resources$\\text{\\textemdash}$such as labour, capital, and raw materials$\\text{\\textemdash}$to produce more of the product ($Q^*$ to $Q_2$) $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This dynamic adjustment ensures that society\'s limited resources are directed towards producing goods consumers value the most, promoting economic efficiency.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/3cfc594b-82a9-4a62-b0ab-5d1ea26b0fc2/images/6c51891e-6b47-4e76-806a-a1681178edca/image.png)\n\n\nThe price mechanism also has a rationing function $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. When an item becomes scarcer or more sought after, its price rises ($P_1$ to $P_2$). As the price increases, the quantity demanded falls ($Q_1$ to $Q_2$) according to the law of demand $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Those consumers with a higher willingness and ability to pay the higher price gain access to the product, while those who are less willing or able to do so may choose to forgo purchasing it or seek alternatives $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.

      'Explain why increased demand for public goods may require increased government spending.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nDemand is the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices over a given period of time, and public goods are a specific category of goods that are characterised by two main properties: they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. These characteristics lead to the free-rider problem: firms cannot charge a price for these goods because it is difficult or impossible to prevent individuals from using the good or service, even if they do not pay for it. Due to these characteristics, markets will not produce public goods, so they are usually produced by the government $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$.\nLike any other good, the demand for public goods may change due to non-price factors such as a change in the perceived personal and collective benefits of a public good $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. For instance, if people believe that a clean environment directly improves their quality of life, they may be more inclined to support environmental regulations and initiatives. A change in their perception could occur due to an awareness and information campaign about the benefits and necessity of a cleaner environment $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/0f90971f-4b50-4b17-a7cf-dd9d9d942b9a/images/bac33f92-0495-466e-9fc3-96274475a974/EC0656a1.docx.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe diagram shows that if the preference for a public good increases, the demand curve will shift to the right. If these goods had a price, the price would increase, and the quantity produced by the private market would also increase ($\\ce{Q_1}$ to $\\ce{Q_2}$) $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$. But in this case, the free-rider problem prevents the price from increasing, so the market will not produce more $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nIf private markets do not meet the increased demand for a good, the government may choose to provide these goods or to increase the amount they already provide $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Therefore, if the government increases its provision of a public good, its spending increases $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ from $\\ce{P_1 \\times Q_1}$ to $\\ce{P_2 \\times Q_2}$ $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly indicating that public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous goods that must be produced by the government: the market will not produce them.

    content: 'Explain any two determinants of price elasticity of supply.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nPrice elasticity of supply (PES) measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity supplied of a product due to a change in its price $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$.\nPES is calculated using the formula:\n$\\hspace{1em}$ $= \\dfrac{\\%\\ \\textrm{change in quantity supplied}}{\\%\\ \\textrm{change in price}}$\nGoods and services have PES values ranging from zero to infinity but the most common ones found in real life would be elastic and inelastic supply. If a product has an elastic supply, a change in price leads to a greater than proportionate change in the quantity supplied, and the value of PES will be greater than 1. Whereas if a product has an inelastic supply then a change in price leads to a less than proportionate change in the quantity supplied, so the value of PES will be less than 1.\nThe time to respond to price changes affects the price elasticity of supply for a product $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Supply tends to be price inelastic in the short run as firms do not necessarily have the resources to increase their output owing to the length of the production process $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. The supply of fruits and vegetables is dependent on the time taken for growing and harvesting these products. Therefore supply of these products would be inelastic as the quantity supplied cannot be increased following an increase in price. Any increase in price will only lead to a less than proportionate change in quantity supplied making them relatively price inelastic $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nIn contrast, mass-produced goods like canned drinks, bottled water are relatively price elastic in the short run as firms can adjust their factors of production to increase their production. Any increase in price will lead to a greater than proportionate change in quantity supplied making them relatively price elastic.\nSimilarly in the long run most of the firms will be able to adjust their factors of production according to changes in the prices. This would make them more elastic in the long run $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nThe mobility of factors of production, which refers to the level of ease and cost of factor mobility and substitution in the production process, also affects PES $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. If factors of production can be easily diverted/substituted, producers can adjust supply in response to changes in price and thus the supply would be relatively elastic $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. For example, if the price of tomatoes increases in comparison to carrots, then producers can divert factors of production used to grow carrots—arable farmland and farm equipment—to the production of tomatoes $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nBy contrast, if resources cannot be easily moved to the production of another good or service, then producers are not able to bring significant changes in the quantity supplied. This makes the supply of goods less responsive to changes in the price, thereby making the goods relative price inelastic $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the term $"$PES$"$ by linking that it is a measure of the degree of responsiveness of quantity supplied of a product due to a change in its price.

    content: 'Explain two determinants of price elasticity of demand.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nPrice elasticity of demand (PED) is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded for a good or service to a change in its price, ceteris paribus $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. The formula below can be used to calculate a product\'s PED:\n$\\hspace{1em}$ $PED = \\dfrac{\\%\\ \\textrm{change in quantity demanded}}{\\%\\ \\textrm{change in price}}$\nThe percentage change in the quantity demanded for a product in response to a given percentage change in its price is dependent on a number of determinants. The (1) number and closeness of substitutes, and (2) degree of necessity are two such determinants of a product\'s PED.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/57819386-d5ab-4970-be5e-1bb6407b9a38/images/47b2c962-b81f-44c5-8069-ccefc28c2573/EC0384a.JPG)\n\n\n\nFirst, the demand for a good/service with a large number of substitutes is price elastic $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. That is, a given percentage increase in the price of the good produces a more than proportionate percentage decrease in the quantity demanded for that good. Price elastic products have an absolute PED value that exceeds 1 (ie., PED $\\gt$ 1) and a relatively flat demand curve (Figure 1). If the price of, for example, a Toyota sedan increases, consumers have a large number of cheaper substitutes available to buy from, such as sedans manufactured by Honda. And so, a 10$\\%$ increase in the price of a Toyota sedan (from $P_1$ to $P_2$ in Figure 1) may produce a 15$\\%$ decrease in the quantity demanded for this car (from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$) $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$ as consumers substitute towards the relatively cheaper Honda sedans $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Relatedly, if consumers perceive Toyota and Honda sedans to be close substitutes, the PED value for a Toyota sedan will be larger than 1.5 (15$\\%$ decrease in quantity demanded divided by a 10$\\%$ increase in price) and, thus, more price elastic.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/57819386-d5ab-4970-be5e-1bb6407b9a38/images/5384b2b7-767a-409b-af27-cf6200423c24/EC0384a.2.JPG)\n\n\n\nSecond, the demand for a product with a high degree of necessity is price inelastic $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. That is, a given percentage increase in the price of the good produces a less than proportionate percentage decrease in the quantity demanded for that good. Price inelastic products have an absolute PED value that is greater than 0 but less than 1 (ie., 0 $<$ PED $<$ 1) and a relatively steep demand curve (Figure 2). Semiconductors, for instance, are an essential input in the production of many consumer durable goods, like cars and home appliances $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. A 10$\\%$ increase in the price of semiconductors (from $P_1$ to $P_2$ in Figure 2), therefore, may only produce an 8$\\%$ decrease in the quantity demanded ($Q_2$ to $Q_1$)  $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$ $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In addition to their necessity in the production of many electronic goods, semiconductors have no close substitutes, which further contributes to their low absolute PED value. Relatedly, certain products may derive their high degree of necessity from their addictive nature. It is the nicotine in cigarettes, for example, that creates a high degree of dependence among its consumers. The more addictive the product is, the smaller its absolute PED value.\nIn the short run, consumers are less responsive to a change in the price of a product if the good/service has a high degree of necessity and little to no close substitutes available.\n\r\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the term $`$price elasticity of demand\' by indicating that it refers to changes in quantity demanded following a change in price or providing the correct formula.

      'Using real-world examples, discuss the importance of a firm understanding how the price elasticity of demand for its products may vary.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nA firm\'s revenue depends on the number of products it sells and the average price of the product it sells. When a firm changes the price of its product, product sales will be affected according to the law of demand $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. But, these impacts differ depending on the determinants of price elasticity of demand (PED) $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$ for the good.\nOne determinant of PED is consumers\' time to respond when buying airline tickets: airfare is usually more expensive if buying it within a few days of the date of travel. For example, a business traveller needing to see a client may have little time to shop for a less expensive ticket and will be willing to pay a higher price $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$. Hence, airlines can increase revenue by keeping the price of tickets high $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ when the date of travel is only a few days away.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/1a97ab1e-6eaf-4f87-94e5-2ef6c4652abd/images/c1a61e59-97e9-4f02-83b9-602cee7cfb0d/EC0376b.JPG)\n\n\nWhen the time to respond is low, PED is more inelastic (its value is lower).  In the diagram above, the demand curve is relatively inelastic, and increasing price ($P_1$ to $P_2$) increases total revenue ($A + B < B + C$) $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/1a97ab1e-6eaf-4f87-94e5-2ef6c4652abd/images/b2d310ff-656d-41af-8b81-19fe8988a6dc/EC0376b.2.JPG)\n\n\nBut, when consumers have more time to find a better deal, airlines can increase revenue by lowering ticket prices $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This is because the time to respond is greater, and PED increases$\\text{\\textemdash}$it becomes more elastic$\\text{\\textemdash}$for this reason. In other words, because consumers shopping for leisure travel have more time to find a better deal or decide against travelling at all, they are more price-sensitive than business travellers $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$.  In the diagram above, the demand curve is relatively more elastic, and lowering the price ($P_1$ to $P_2$) increases total revenue $(A+B < B+C$) $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\nConsequently, an airline wishing to maximise revenue should increase prices when the PED is inelastic and decrease prices when the PED is elastic. However, there are several assumptions that airlines should also consider. For example, commercial airlines have limited capacity $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$: their planes have a fixed number of seats, and airlines cannot change their routes easily $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$. So, if airlines set the price too low, filling their seats with leisure travellers, they give up the opportunity to sell more expensive tickets to business travellers. But, if they set the price too high, they risk not selling all the available seats, and losing out on potential revenue. To maximise revenue, airlines must have a finely-tuned understanding of how the PED of their customers varies $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$.\nAnother problem is that business travellers are not the only consumers who need to travel on short notice $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$. In particular, in the case of natural disasters, humanitarian crises, or family emergencies, air travellers often need to make travel plans quickly. Maximising revenue by charging high prices to these consumers can be seen as price gouging, which may hurt the airline\'s reputation (and ticket sales) over time $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$.\nPerhaps this explains why airlines increasingly use additional methods to increase revenue, such as dividing the cabin into additional fare tiers or charging for baggage, meals, or the ability to choose one\'s seat $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$. In these practices, airlines are able to extract more revenue from less price-sensitive customers without having to only rely on response time to increase or decrease their revenue.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the term price elasticity of demand by indicating that it is the degree to which the quantity demanded changes in response to a change in price.

      'Explain two factors that determine why primary commodities are less responsive to price changes than manufactured goods.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nPrice elasticity of supply (PES) measures the change in quantity supplied of a good due to a change in its price $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$.\nPES = $\\dfrac{\\ce{\\% change in quantity supplied}}{\\ce{\\% change in price}} \\times 100$\nIf the PES value exceeds 1, then the supply is price elastic, meaning producers are more sensitive to price changes. A value less than 1 means supply is price inelastic—producers are less sensitive to price changes. PES can be affected by factors such as the ability to store stocks, time period, type of production method, mobility of factors of production, and using underemployed resources $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nThe PES for primary commodities is relatively low due to the comparatively long time it takes to increase primary sector production such as agricultural products. However, the PES for manufactured goods (like shoes) is higher as many of these can be mass-produced in less time. Additionally, even though it’s possible to store primary output like wheat, such goods are perishable and can be damaged $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This makes it difficult to hold stocks of primary goods over time. However, manufactured goods such as furniture can be stored for longer. Such goods may become outdated, but they do not perish over time like primary commodities. Thus, the PES of manufactured goods tends to be higher than that of primary commodities because manufacturers can release stored inventory when the price increases $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nFurthermore, capital-intensive production in the manufacturing sector means it is relatively easy to raise output, while production tends to be land-intensive in the primary sector $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. Land is fixed in supply—once crops have been planted, the capacity is effectively fixed, at least in the short run. Additionally, labour-intensive\nproduction in the primary sector can be costly, which limits the ability of firms to increase output despite price hikes $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nThis can be understood by comparing supply curves for both primary commodities and manufactured goods. As seen in the diagram, an increase in price from $\\ce{P_1}$ to $\\ce{P_2}$ has led to a less than proportionate increase in quantity supplied for primary goods ($\\ce{Q_1}$ to $\\ce{Q_2}$) $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$. This means supply is price inelastic, representing the fact that producers are less responsive to price changes.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/1d8a318f-b42f-407f-8abd-bddbb31cc5b0/images/c23544db-1993-44b8-afee-9032880099bf/EC0591A.png)\n\n\nHowever, as seen on the supply curve for manufactured goods, an increase in price from $\\ce{P_1}$ to $\\ce{P_2}$ has led to a more than proportionate increase in quantity supplied from $\\ce{Q_1}$ to $\\ce{Q_3}$ $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.

      "Using real-world examples, examine the role of price elasticity of demand on a government's decision to levy indirect taxes on certain goods to increase tax revenue.",
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nIn an effort to increase tax revenues, governments resort to levying indirect taxes, which are taxes on the sale of goods and services $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. Decisions about which goods or services a government should tax for the purpose of increasing tax revenue can largely be dependent on the price elasticity of demand (PED) for these products. PED is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded for a good or service to a change in its price, ceteris paribus $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/5865564d-6c69-4499-9f3b-b528ff519c9e/images/6f39cc7a-0b87-47c3-b2e8-aee3a9dfe62e/EC0384b.JPG)\n\n\n\nSince 2018, the Irish government has levied an indirect tax, known as the Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax, on the sale of sugary drinks, such as soft drinks $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$. In Figure 1, the relatively steep demand curve for high-sugar soft drinks stems from its low absolute PED value. The demand for sugary drinks is price inelastic largely because of its high degree of necessity. Specifically, consumers form a dependency on sugary drinks because sugar is addictive $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nImposing an indirect tax of 30c per litre on soft drinks has the effect of raising drinks manufacturers\' cost of production, which causes a leftward shift of the supply curve for soft drinks from $S_1$ to $S_2$ $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$. Despite the increase in price of soft drinks from $P_M$ to $P_C$, there is a less than proportionate decrease in the quantity demanded for this addictive product ($Q_M$ to $Q_T$). The gain in revenue from selling the sugary drink at a higher price ($P_C$ $>$ $P_M$) is greater than the loss of revenue from selling fewer units of soft drinks ($Q_T$ $<$ $Q_M$) $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This revenue, equivalent to areas a$+$b$+$d or (($P_C$ $-$ $P_P$) $x$ $Q_T$), is collected by the Irish government as tax $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$. In 2022, the Irish government collected $\\euro$32 million in tax revenues from the sugar tax alone, accomplishing the goal of raising government revenue $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$.\nDespite the possibility of collecting large volumes of tax revenues, the loss of total revenue earned by drinks manufacturers may be harmful to a government. At the free market equilibrium (point X), total revenue earned by firms is equal to areas d$+$e$+$f$+$g$+$h (or $P_M$ $x$ $Q_M$). Levying an indirect tax, however, moves the market to a new, after-tax equilibrium at point Y. As the indirect tax lowers the price received by producers from $P_M$ to $P_P$ and lowers the quantity of output sold from $Q_M$ to $Q_T$, drinks manufacturers experience a fall in total revenue, which is now equal to areas f$+$g (or $P_P$ $x$ $Q_T$). If producers\' costs of production remain unchanged, the reduced profits earned by drinks manufacturers lowers the direct corporate taxes collected by the government.\nAdditionally, drink manufacturers may respond to this loss of profitability by firing workers. In response, a government may use scarce tax revenues to support these unemployed workers. And so, despite the relatively large tax revenues earned from imposing the indirect tax on a specific good with a low PED, governments may experience a loss of tax revenues from struggling firms and unemployed workers.\nGovernments must also pay heed to the impact of time on the size of these tax revenues collected. If the price of these taxed goods remain elevated for a long period of time, their low PED values will eventually become bigger in the long run, causing a fall in tax revenues collected. This was the experience for the Canadian province of Quebec in 2023 where persistently high cigarette prices (from taxes) prompted consumers to substitute cheaper tobacco alternatives, like vapes or e-cigarettes $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$. Therefore, over the long run, governments must account for dwindling tax revenues collected from taxing price inelastic products as newer, often unregulated, substitute products eventually enter the market $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/5865564d-6c69-4499-9f3b-b528ff519c9e/images/e5dc0a4e-62cb-4d83-8498-e17dbf1c6cbc/EC0384b.2.JPG)\n\n\n\r\nIt is imprudent for governments to tax goods or services with high PEDs if their objective is to increase tax revenues. The Norwegian government should, therefore, reconsider its proposal to impose an indirect tax on luxury electric cars, like Porsche and Jaguar, for the purpose of increasing tax revenues $\\textcolor{#C34A2C}{[\\textbf{RWE}]}$. In Figure 2, the relatively flat demand curve for luxury cars stems from its high absolute PED value. The demand for luxury vehicles, even in a high-income country like Norway, is price elastic because it accounts for a large proportion of a consumer\'s income. The availability of close substitutes, like generic electric vehicles, further contribute to its high PED value as consumers can substitute towards cheaper alternatives $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. This can be seen in Figure 2 where the increase in price of luxury cars from $P_M$ to $P_C$ produces a more than proportionate decrease in the quantity demanded for this luxury good ($Q_M$ to $Q_T$). This revenue, equivalent to areas a$+$b$+$d or (($P_C$ $-$ $P_P$) $x$ $Q_T$), is collected by the government as tax.\nThe loss of revenue from the fewer units of luxury cars sold ($Q_T$ $<$ $Q_M$) exceeds the gain in revenue from selling the luxury car at a higher price ($P_C$ $>$ $P_M$). This helps explain why the government revenue collected from taxing a price elastic good is smaller than the government revenue earned from taxing a price inelastic good, like soft drinks $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. The tax revenue area in Figure 1 is larger than the tax revenue area in Figure 2.\nIf the main objective is to increase tax revenue, governments should levy indirect taxes on goods with low absolute PED values. The Irish government\'s indirect tax on sugary drinks, for example, is a prudent policy used to increase tax revenues; however, policymakers should contend with the possibility of negative employment effects on the taxed industry and the increasing PED value of taxed goods over the long run $\\textcolor{#20B2AA}{[\\textbf{S/E}]}$.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the term $`$price elasticity of demand\' by indicating that it refers to changes in quantity demanded following a change in price or providing the correct formula and $`$indirect tax\' by indicating that it is a tax on the sale of goods and services.

      'Explain why, for an economy operating at a point on its production possibilities curve (PPC), choices about what to produce might be necessary.',
    markScheme:
      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nWhen an economy operates along its production possibilities curve (PPC), it faces fundamental choices about how to allocate its limited resources to produce various goods and services. The scarcity of resources—land, labour, capital, and technology—prevents the production of unlimited quantities of goods and services . If these resources are fully employed, the production of more goods or services implies sacrificing the production of other goods and services $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nThe PPC illustrates the maximum output combinations of two goods that an economy can achieve using its available resources efficiently $\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}$. If it operates inside the PPC, it indicates the underutilization of resources. An economy utilising all of its resources efficiently $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ produces at a point on the PPC $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.  Every choice along the PPC involves opportunity costs, which represent the value of the next best alternative that is forgone. If an economy decides to produce more of one good, it must reduce the production of another good $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$. In other words, there is a trade-off between the production of the two goods or services included in the model if resources are used efficiently.  For example, increasing the production of healthcare may mean sacrificing some units of education:\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/641ebfa6-e959-45e7-bb5c-4d85e848d48d/images/2f9dcb71-b726-4004-9844-7f9ab74d4cce/EC0682A.png)\n\n\nIf an economy producing at point A wants to provide more education services, it must produce at point B; doing so involves an opportunity cost—2 fewer units of health care services will be supplied $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\nIn summary, the decision regarding which point to produce on the PPC is vital due to the scarcity of resources and the inherent trade-offs involved when there is full employment of resources. Scarce resources require societies to make production choices to best satisfy their needs $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the term production possibilities curve by indicating that it illustrates the maximum output combinations of two goods that an economy can achieve using its available resources efficiently.

      '$\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}$: \nThe circular flow of income is an economic model that illustrates how money flows through an economy between different sectors.

Injections are investment, government spending, and spending on exports $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$, and leakages are savings, taxes, and spending on imports $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nThe following diagram illustrates this model adding the leakages and injections.\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/b168ff7e-e178-4d9c-bf54-65e7d523f842/images/91393d4e-4321-4ea5-9c4e-90ab5ada9822/EC0683.docx%20(1).jpg)\n\n\nBased on the diagram above, it is evident that if the leakages are greater than the injections, the size of the circular flow becomes smaller $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$ and if injections are larger than leakages the size of the circular flow of income increases $\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}$.\nSavings leak out of the circular flow and after passing through the financial markets are injected back as investment. Taxes leak out when paid to the government, which injects them back into the flow of income as government spending and imports are leakages as they are bought from other countries but other countries inject money into the flow of income as the exports they buy from domestic producers $\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}$.\nAn example of how the size of the circular flow of income is affected by leakages would be that if there are too many taxes, people will have less disposable income and will purchase fewer products. Then companies will need to reduce their production, dismiss workers, and households will receive less income. In this case, the circular flow of income will shrink.\n$\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation}}$:\n$\\textcolor{#00CED1}{\\textbf{Terminology}\\ [\\textbf{T}]}$\nFor correctly using the term circular flow of income by indicating that it is a model that depicts the interactions between households, businesses, the government, the financial sector and the foreign sector, showing how income is generated and spent.

      'Though it is the world\'s largest vanilla producer and rich in minerals like nickel and gold, Madagascar faces persistent poverty, slow economic growth, and poor governance. Agriculture, fishing, and forestry dominate the economy: seventy per cent of the labour force works in these sectors. Eighty per cent of the country\'s population lives below the poverty line of US$1.90 per day.\nIn contrast, Denmark is a mixed economy that enjoys high living standards and an annual per capita income of over US$60 000. Its economy is focused on services, trade, and manufacturing, while only a small part of the population is employed in agriculture and fishing.\n\n- Explain how the economic concept of (relative) scarcity is likely to differ between the economies of Madagascar and Denmark. <span class="marks">[3]</span>\n\n- Explain why Madagascar and Denmark both face the problem of scarcity despite the difference in their levels of economic development. <span class="marks">[3]</span>\n\n- Explain the opportunity cost that Denmark and Madagascar would face if each government decided to build a new international airport in its capital city. <span class="marks">[4]</span>\n\n',

      "\n- $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$:\nBoth the economies of Madagascar and Denmark face the economic concept of scarcity since their resources are limited. However, while scarcity in Madagascar means that people cannot access basic necessities such as food or clean water, in Denmark it means that they cannot afford all their wants, such as a new car or a second home.\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation:}}$\nFor explaining that both countries face the economic problem of scarcity since there is a limit to their available resources (land, labour, capital) and their economic output ($\\checkmark$).\n  For explaining the difference in how scarcity presents itself in the two countries.\n  \n  - For Madagascar, scarcity means a lack of basic necessities/needs such as water, staple food, shelter and/or essential medicines ($\\checkmark$).\n  - For Denmark, scarcity means not being able to have access to all wants, while all basic needs are satisfied ($\\checkmark$).\n\n- $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$:\nScarcity occurs when the available resources cannot satisfy all needs and wants. As both countries have limited economic resources (such as land, capital and labour) and unlimited wants, each country's production is finite, which leads to scarcity despite the differences in their levels of development.\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation:}}$\nFor explaining that scarcity occurs because not all needs and wants can be satisfied given the available resources ($\\checkmark$).\n  For explaining that both countries experience limited resources but have unlimited wants—this is the fundamental economic problem ($\\checkmark$).\n  For explaining that scarcity can be seen as each country's production is finite, thus not all wants can be fully satisfied ($\\checkmark$).\n- $\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer}}$:\nAs Madagascar is a poor country with 80$\\%$ of its population below the poverty line, building a new international airport in its capital city may be extremely costly for its government. It may have to reduce or halt other essential public services, such as education and healthcare, which would represent a high opportunity cost.\r\nIn contrast, Denmark is a richer country with average annual incomes of over US$60 000. Building a new international airport may not prove so challenging for its government, which could maintain all or most of the public services it provides. This means Denmark would face a much lower opportunity cost than Madagascar.\n  $\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation:}}$\nFor explaining that the government of a poor country like Madagascar may have very limited public finances, which is supported by the fact that 80$\\%$ of the population lives below the poverty line ($\\checkmark$).\n  For explaining that for Madagascar, building an international airport may result in the reduction or suspension of other government-funded services due to the lack of money. These services are highly important for a country, which means Madagascar would face a high opportunity cost ($\\checkmark$).\n  For explaining that the government of a rich country like Denmark may have better public finances, which can be seen by the fact that the average income in the country is over US$60 000 ($\\checkmark$).\n  For explaining that for Denmark, building an international airport is not likely to significantly reduce government-funded services, which would result in a lower opportunity cost than in Madagascar ($\\checkmark$).\n",
