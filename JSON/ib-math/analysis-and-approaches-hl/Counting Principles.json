Therefore,\n$The two possible combinations are a=2,b=6 and a=8,b=24.​$\n\n\nIf $P(0)=24$, we have\n$$$P(0)24​=a(0)3+b(0)2+c(0)+d=d​$$$\nThe coefficients must all be different. If $d=24$, $b=24$, so we have from part (b)(i) that $a=2$ and $b=6$. Therefore $c=8$.\n$If P(0)=24, we must have a=2,b=6,c=8 and d=24.​$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur polynomial is $P(x)=2x3+6x2+8x+24$. Given that $x+3$ is a factor, we have\n$$$2x3+6x2+8x+242x3+6x2+8x+24​=(x+3)(2x2+ex+8)=2x3+ex2+8x+6x2+3ex+24=2x3+(e+6)x2+(8+3e)x+24​$$$\nEquating the coefficients of $x2$ and $x$ on the LHS and RHS, we have\n$$$68​=e+6=8+3e​$$$\nWe must have $e=0$. Therefore\n$$$P(x)​=(x+3)(2x2+8)P(x)=2(x+3)(x2+4)​​$$$\n\n\nWe have from part (b)(i) that $x1​=−3$. To find the other two roots, we solve $x2+4=0$:\n$$$x2+4x2xx​=0=−4=±−4​=±2i​$$$\n$The roots of P(x) are x1​=−3,x2​=−2i, and x3​=2i.​$\n\n\n\n",
