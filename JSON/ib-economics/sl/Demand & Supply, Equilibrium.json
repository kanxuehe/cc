      "markScheme": "Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods, can damage production facilities, transportation infrastructure, andsupply chains[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. This disruption reduces the quantity of basic goods available in the market, creatingscarcity[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. In the aftermath of a disaster, consumers often fear shortages and may rush to stockpile essential items such as food, water, and medical supplies[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. This sudden increase in demand can quickly outstrip the available supply, leading toexcessdemand. The combination of supply disruptions and panic-driven consumer behaviour can lead to a significant mismatch between the supply of basic goods and the heightened demand following a natural disaster, resulting in excess demand andshortages. Excess demand occurs when the price is set belowequilibrium[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}[T]. This is so because prices take time to adjust and while prices are below the equilibrium, demand exceeds the quantity supplied[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. Price may be below the equilibrium also because the government may intervene in the market preventing the rise of the staples prices in the aftermath of a natural disaster.\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/ad389e8d-8cdd-43fb-a5d1-8375912aad3f/images/e5499e1f-90fa-4a63-9e86-f77854d8b02c/EC0686A.png)\n\nAs the diagram above shows, when demand increases, the previous equilibrium price (PX1\\ce{P_1}PX1​) is below the new equilibrium price (PX2\\ce{P_2}PX2​).

This shortage will force P to increase up to the equilibrium price[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D].Further reasons why there could be an excess demand after a natural disaster is that people may anticipate further disruptions or prolonged shortages, prompting them to buy more than they typically would. This heightened demand can contribute to excess demand even if the supply is only temporarily reduced.Retailers may face challenges in restocking goods quickly due to supply chain interruptions.

      "markScheme": "Sample Answer‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample Answer}}Sample Answer​:An increase in the price of beef can have distinct effects on the supply of leather and the supply of poultry due to the concepts of joint supply and competitive supply. A change in the price of a related product is a non-price determinant of supply and will shift the supply curve of the product under consideration[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].Competitive supplymeans that the output of one product prevents or limits the output of alternative products[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}[T].Joint supplymeans that the supply of a product results in the supply of at least one by-product[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}[T]. This explains how the price of related goods can affect the supply of individual producers.In the case of competitive supply, if a firm produces different products, a change in the price of one product may affect the output of another of its products because producers have limited resources so they cannot supply more of one product without producing less of the other products. Beef and poultry are in competitive supply[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX], so if the price of beef increases, the producer has more incentives to produce more beef and the amount of poultry produced will need to be reduced[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].\n\n![SkillUpp Image](https://assets.revisionvillage.com/public/question/14fcf616-0d20-4ccc-9d7e-c39398152f94/images/a7410515-6faf-43fa-825d-47a09717a4cd/EC0685.docx%20(3).jpg)\n\nWhen the price of beef increases, producers will increase the resources they use for beef production and the quantity of beef supplied will increase. The higher price of beef disincentivizes poultry production, which is in competitive supply with beef.

Prices efficientlyallocatescarce resources by conveying information about the relative desirability and scarcity of goods and services in the market. Producers reallocate their productive resources to the products that have the highest prices.When the price is set atP∗P^*P∗, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal (Q∗Q^*Q∗). But if demand for the product increases (D1D_1D1​toD2D_2D2​), its price rises (P∗P^*P∗toP2P_2P2​)[D]\\textcolor{#056608}{[\\textbf{D}]}[D], signalling to producers that there is an increased desire for that item[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX].

When an item becomes scarcer or more sought after, its price rises (P1P_1P1​toP2P_2P2​).

      "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused a 25-fold increase in demand for face masks, particularly in countries where they were not commonly used before, like the USA.The rapid surge in demand caused prices to skyrocket by as much as 300%, while some medical equipment suppliers paused the production of other items to channel their resources into making more face masks. They wanted to provide assistance to their communities, but also take advantage of the all-time high prices and make record profits.Despite the high price for consumers, face masks were essential in protecting public health by slowing the spread of the virus, particularly among vulnerable groups.Sketch a D/S diagram to illustrate the possible effect on the market for face masks due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.[3]Explain the role that the incentive function of the price mechanism had for suppliers of face masks during the pandemic.[3]Explain the likely changes in the price elasticity of demand (PED) for face masks before and during the pandemic.[3]Explain the positive externality resulting from wearing face masks during the pandemic.[3]",

In this case, the 25-fold price increase indicated that this item was highly valuable to consumers, which drove producers to pause other productions to focus their resources on making face masks. This incentivised producers to increase the supply of face masks, so consumers' needs could be promptly satisfied.Explanation:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation:}}Explanation:​For explaining the incentive function of the price mechanism:The significant increase in the price of face masks served as a signal to producers: it conveyed the information that consumers highly valued face masks due to the pandemic (✓\\checkmark✓).The higher price for face masks created incentives for producers (✓\\checkmark✓)  to direct their limited resources into producing face masks and increasing the overall supply (✓\\checkmark✓).Sample answer:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer:}}Sample answer:​Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the responsiveness of a change in the quantity demanded to a  change in price. Before the pandemic, face masks were not considered essential items in many countries, meaning their PED was elastic (PED > 1). During the pandemic, face masks were seen as indispensable items to protect people from the virus, causing their PED to become  inelastic (PED < 1).Explanation:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Explanation:}}Explanation:​For stating that the PED for face masks fell, or became more inelastic (✓\\checkmark✓)For explaining that the PED for face masks before the pandemic was likely to be elastic as they were not considered essential or important items (✓\\checkmark✓).For explaining that the PED for face masks during the pandemic was likely to be inelastic/very inelastic as they were considered essential to prevent the virus from spreading (✓\\checkmark✓).Sample answer:‾\\underline{\\textrm{Sample answer:}}Sample answer:​A positive externality occurs when someone's action has a benefit to a third party.

These characteristics lead to thefree-rider problem: firms cannot charge a price for these goods because it is difficult or impossible to prevent individuals from using the good or service, even if they do not pay for it. Due to these characteristics, markets will not produce public goods, so they are usually produced by the government[T]\\textcolor{#00CED1}{[\\textbf{T}]}[T].Like any other good, the demand for public goods may change due tonon-price factorssuch as a change in the perceived personal and collective benefits of a public good[EX]\\textcolor{#1974D2}{[\\textbf{EX}]}[EX]. For instance, if people believe that a clean environment directly improves their quality of life, they may be more inclined to support environmental regulations and initiatives.
